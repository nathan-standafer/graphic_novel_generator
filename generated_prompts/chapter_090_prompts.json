    "image_prompt": "A moody, high‑contrast illustration of a stern 19th‑century maritime courtroom: an elderly lawyer in a black robe, William Prynne, stands before a vaulted stone judge’s bench, holding a parchment titled “Treatise on Queen Gold.” He points to a carved whale tail beside a regal throne, while a royal crest glows. The scene is bathed in deep navy and charcoal tones with sharp chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, evoking Romantic realism of the 1800s."

    "image_prompt": "A dim, soot‑stained 19th‑century shipyard at dusk, navy shadows and charcoal accents cast by a single lantern. A rugged whaler holds a gleaming black limber bone from a Greenland right whale, while an elegant seamstress in linen cuffs carefully stitches it into the bodice of a lady’s gown, her eyes reflecting the harsh light. Fine linework meets semi‑realistic gradients, paper grain texture, sharp chiaroscuro—Romantic realism, 1800s maritime atmosphere."

    "image_prompt": "A moody, high‑contrast illustration of an old sea‑lawyer, parchment in hand, standing beside a massive whale’s exposed head on a stormy dock. The whale’s bone ribs gleam under sharp chiaroscuro lighting, while the lawyer’s disapproving gaze points to the missing tail. Dark navy and charcoal tones dominate, with fine linework blending into semi‑realistic gradients, capturing 19th‑century whaling tension in Romantic realism style."

Dark charcoal cliffs loom behind, silhouettes of gulls and storm‑tossed waves contrast sharply.

Ishmael, Queequeg, Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask observe from below, their faces lit by a single lantern’s chiaroscuro glow. In the foreground, a stylized whale head rises like an ancient altar, its bone‑white ribs subtly forming a regal crown, hinting at allegorical symbolism. Romantic realism, 19th‑century naval drama."

The scene exudes Romantic realism, deep navy and charcoal tones, fine linework with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain—capturing the tense, austere mood of a royal decree on maritime treasure."

A scholarly gentleman in a waistcoat holds a yellowed page of Blackstone’s commentary, his brow furrowed as he gazes at the viewer; beside him, a hushed crowd of mariners in rough wool coats listen intently. Moody chiaroscuro highlights the candle flame, deep navy and charcoal tones dominate, Romantic realism with fine linework and subtle paper grain."

A regal figure—an imagined king in period armor—reaches for the dense, elastic head, his hand trembling with symbolic reverence, while shadowed sailors watch in hushed awe. The scene is rendered in Romantic realism: deep navy and charcoal tones, fine linework blending into semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain, evoking a 19th‑century whaling voyage."

A battered whaleboat lies on the shore with a massive whale head and tail exposed, flanked by weary Dover mariners in rolled trousers and a stern Lord Warden clutching Blackstone’s law book. Fine linework blends into semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain accentuating tension of legal dispute over royal fish."
