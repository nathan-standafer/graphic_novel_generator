    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit 19th‑century chapel, a tall wooden pulpit carved like a ship’s bow dominates the foreground; behind it, rows of stone benches and stained‑glass windows recede into shadow. The back wall bears an enormous oil painting of a storm‑tossed vessel, its sails flaring against black clouds. In the rear corners, a lone candle flickers, casting trembling light on carved sea‑motifs. The scene feels claustrophobic, as if all life and drama flow from the pulpit’s forward face toward this austere, rearward gloom—an oil painting in dark, moody tones."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit, storm‑ridden chapel interior in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil style: Father Mapple stands at an imposing, ship‑shaped pulpit, its prow-like paneling and beak‑like Bible stand gleaming faintly. A side ladder of red rope rises like a mast to the lofty platform; he ascends with sailor’s grace, eyes upward as if summoning celestial winds. The pulpit looms over a sea‑tinted wall painting of a gallant ship battling black rocks beneath a radiant angelic sun—“the pulpit leads the world.”"

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit chapel where a lofty pulpit shaped like a weathered ship’s bow dominates the frame; heavy iron rope ladder hangs beside it, its wooden joints glinting in candlelight. Above, a tempestuous sky swirls with dark clouds and jagged lightning, while a faint golden halo of divine light breaks through, illuminating the pulpit’s carved prow. The preacher—Father Mapple—stands at the top, his face solemn, as thunderous words about God’s wrath echo from his lips, the storm’s first blow striking the ship‑shaped altar. A dark, moody 19th-century oil painting."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit chapel with a lofty pulpit shaped like a ship’s prow, its wooden boards weathered and stained mahogany. Father Mupple stands at the top, his weather‑worn coat draped over his shoulders, clutching a brass rosary that glints faintly in the candlelight. He raises one hand, eyes closed, as if summoning the wind itself; wisps of mist curl around the pulpit’s curved edges, evoking stormy seas and calm breezes alike. The scene is rendered in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit, storm‑laden chapel interior in a somber 19th‑century oil style: Father Mapple, weathered yet dignified, stands on a wooden ladder beside an austere pulpit shaped like a ship’s prow. The pulpit’s carved bow and biblical scroll echo maritime themes, while distant waves crash against the walls. In the gloom, a single shaft of light falls upon the preacher, symbolizing the world as a vessel in motion, its journey incomplete, with the pulpit guiding its course. Dark, moody, 19th‑century oil painting."
