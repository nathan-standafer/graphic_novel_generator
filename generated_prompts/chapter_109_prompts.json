    "image_prompt": "A tense cabin scene aboard the Pequod at dawn, Captain Ahab in his weather‑worn coat and spattered face, staring at Starbuck with a half‑raised musket, eyes narrowed, lips pursed. The dim interior is lit by flickering lanterns, shadows clinging to wooden beams. Ahab’s voice echoes: “Beware of Ahab,” as the stormy sea roils outside. Romantic realism, deep navy and charcoal tones, chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain—19th‑century whaling voyage."

    "image_prompt": "Ahab, eyes aflame, holds his musket like a trembling staff; its iron brow gleams in dim lantern light as he paces back‑and‑forth through the cramped cabin, maps of Japan spread before him. The air hangs heavy with oil fumes and salt spray, shadows deepening on cracked wood planks. In moody Romantic realism, navy–charcoal tones dominate, chiaroscuro sharp, fine linework blending into semi‑realistic gradients—capturing a 19th‑century whaling ship’s tense interior."

    "image_prompt": "Ahab, visor‑shaded face slackening, returns a musket to its wooden rack in the dim, soot‑stained cabin of the Pequod; his broad shoulders and weathered coat hint at 19th‑century maritime grit. He steps out onto the deck, wind whipping his dark beard, as the ship’s lanterns cast sharp chiaroscuro against the black hull. Romantic realism, deep navy & charcoal tones, fine linework with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain – 1800s whaling voyage."

He gestures to furled tagalant sails, reefed topsails, lowered main yard, and hoisted Burtons into the hold, all under sharp chiaroscuro lighting.

He gestures toward a chart of oriental islands, his musket resting against the table’s back, while steam from leaking casks curls in the air. The tension of command is palpable—Ahab’s action, a silent homage to Starbuck, rendered in Romantic realism with fine linework and subtle paper grain."

The heavy wooden table holds a battered chart of Japanese coasts, inked in deep navy and charcoal. Starbuck looms in shadow, eyes narrowed, as Ahab’s expression hardens with sudden honesty.

The scene is moody Romantic realism: deep navy and charcoal tones, sharp chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain—19th‑century whaling tension captured in dramatic illustration."
