    "image_prompt": "A somber ship’s galley at twilight, a hushed crew gathered around a cracked wooden table. In the center, an elderly whaleman—Stubb—holds a battered quill poised over a parchment titled “Circular of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders.” His weathered hands contrast with the deep navy, charcoal‑tinted sea beyond the porthole, sharp chiaroscuro lighting casting long shadows on the worn wood. Romantic realism, 19th‑century maritime atmosphere."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit, cramped study aboard the Pequod’s galley, where Captain Ahab and Starbuck sit at a scarred oak table surrounded by old whaling journals. A hushed council of sailors—Stubb, Flask, Ishmael—gather, clutching steel pens that gleam in the low lantern light. In the foreground, a hand presses a resolution parchment stamped “Society Resolution.” Moody navy and charcoal tones dominate, sharp chiaroscuro illuminating faces, fine linework blending into semi‑realistic gradients with subtle paper grain – Romantic realism of 19th‑century whaling."
