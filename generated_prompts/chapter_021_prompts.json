A weathered rigger, face lined with soot and salt‑cracked skin, stands amid tangled rigging, his voice echoing: “Starbucks a steer.” He gestures toward the prow where a lone figure—Captain Ahab—remains hidden behind a curtain of tarred sails. Queequeg leans in, eyes narrowed, while Ishmael watches with wary curiosity. The scene is rendered as a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

The men—Ishmael, Queequeg, Starbuck, Stubb, Flask—move briskly, carrying tools and ropes, while the riggers bustle about, tightening lines and securing gear. The Pequod’s stern looms in the background, its hull weather‑scarred, as a thin haze curls around the gangway, evoking tension before Ahab’s looming presence."

The sea churns quietly, gulls cry in distance, while the crew’s silhouettes move along the deck, unaware of the unseen tyrant in the cabin. Dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."
