    "segment_text": "When Brahma, or the god of gods, saith the shastra, resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnu to preside over the work, but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnu before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects,",
