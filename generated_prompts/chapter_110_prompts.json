    "image_prompt": "Queequeg, in the dim lantern‑lit hold of the Pequod, leans over his battered coffin, eyes fierce with defiant conviction. The ship’s wooden deck looms beneath a stormy navy sky; sharp chiaroscuro casts deep shadows across weathered planks and twisted rigging. He declares that resolve alone can defeat sickness, only a whale or gale may claim him—an embodiment of Romantic realism in 19th‑century maritime drama, with fine linework and subtle paper grain."
