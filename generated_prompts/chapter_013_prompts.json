    "image_prompt": "A dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting of a stormy harbor at dusk: the battered schooner “Moby Dick” lies in shallow gray water, its deck littered with splintered wood and broken rope. Near the bow, a hulking Queequeg, tanned and scarred, is caught mid‑air as he dives into the frothy sea, his harpoon gleaming. Ishmael, on the railing, clings to the ship’s timbers like a barnacle, eyes fixed on the sinking figure below, while waves crash against weathered hulls in muted blues and grays."

    "image_prompt": "A dim, storm‑shrouded harbor at dusk, a battered Nantucket packet‑schooner creaking on slick waves. In the foreground, Queequeg lies motionless in a shallow pool of frothy sea, his broad chest heaving faintly as if asleep; a harpoon rests beside him, its tip glinting in weak moonlight. Around him, shadowed crew members stare in hushed awe, their faces pale and ghost‑like against the oil‑slick horizon. The scene is rendered in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style."

    "image_prompt": "A dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting of Queequeg standing alone on a stormy ship deck, wind whipping his tanned skin, eyes narrowed in defiance. He holds a polished harpoon, unbowed by applause, with the sea’s gray spray swirling around him. In the background, shadowed crew members look on skeptically; a muted banner of a “medal” hangs uselessly beside a cracked wooden table. The atmosphere is tense, brooding, and starkly realistic, capturing Queequeg’s uncomplimentary stance toward human accolades. Style: 19th‑century oil painting."

    "image_prompt": "A tense moment aboard a storm‑tossed whaling schooner, Queequeg leaning against battered bulwarks, eyes fixed on distant waves as he clutches a cracked tin cup of water. His weathered face is illuminated by flickering lantern light, brine streaks drying from his dark skin. The deck creaks under heavy rope‑tension; the sea roils in foreboding darkness. A somber, 19th‑century oil painting style, moody and dramatic, capturing the raw struggle of man against nature."

    "image_prompt": "A dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting of Queequeg on the bulwarks of a whaling schooner after a storm. He is in crisp, tattered dry clothes, his pipe glowing faintly as he leans against the wooden rail, eyes scanning the crew below with calm resolve. The deck is slick with foam, gulls cry overhead, and the moonlit sea reflects muted lantern light. The atmosphere feels tense yet contemplative, capturing a moment of quiet reflection amid nautical chaos."

The moon hangs low over turbulent waves, and the crew’s silhouettes loom in shadowed rigging. He holds a humble pipe, eyes steady on the Christian sailors below, proclaiming with quiet resolve that “we cannibals must help these Christians.” A brooding, moody oil painting captures the tense camaraderie amid stormy night."
