    "image_prompt": "A dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting: a storm‑laden deck of the Pequod at night, Captain Ahab stands in tattered coat, eyes fixed on the horizon where a massive white whale glides like a spectral demon. His crew—Ishmael, Queequeg, Starbuck, Stubb, Flask—look on with haunted faces, their shadows elongated by lantern light, as they grapple with unseen fears and the relentless pull of revenge. The sea roils in foreboding gloom."

    "segment_text": "a subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever-shifting, muffled sound of his pick?",
    "image_prompt": "A dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting shows Captain Ahab and Ishmael standing on a creaking deck under stormy skies, their faces lit by flickering lanterns. In the foreground a colossal, swirling whirlpool rises from the sea, its depths hinting at a subterranean miner – a metaphoric shaft of darkness. The scene captures the eerie, muffled echo of Ahab’s relentless quest for Moby Dick, as waves crash against the Pequod’s hull in ominous rhythm. Style: 19th‑century oil painting."

    "image_prompt": "A shadowy Pequod prowls a storm‑laden Atlantic, its deck roiled by relentless waves; Captain Ahab stands at the helm, his iron leg gleaming, eyes fixed on an unseen horizon where the white whale lingers. Beside him, Ishmael and Queequeg lean over, their faces pale with dread, while Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask stare ahead, each feeling the invisible, irresistible arm‑drag of destiny pulling them toward Moby Dick. Dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

    "image_prompt": "A lone skiff drifts silently beside the prow of a massive seventy‑four‑gun warship, its canvas tattered, crew absent, while storm‑black waves crash against iron ribs. In the gloom a solitary figure—Captain Ahab—eyes the horizon with fierce intent, his scarred face illuminated by lantern light. The scene captures the bleak, foreboding mood of 19th‑century maritime dread in an oil painting style, dark and moody, evoking the relentless chase of Moby Dick."

    "segment_text": "For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place, but while yet all a rush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.",
    "image_prompt": "A lone sailor, Ishmael, stands in the storm‑laden deck of the Pequod, wind whipping his tattered coat, as he gazes toward a vast, moonlit ocean where an enormous white whale glides unseen. His face is drained of hope, eyes reflecting the grim determination of the crew’s relentless chase. Around him, crew members in ragged whaling gear look on with hollow awe, their faces pale and haunted by the dread of the deadliest ill lurking beneath. The scene is rendered as a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."
