    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit harbor at dusk, a lone ragged sailor—Elijah—lingers in the misty shadows, his tattered coat and sallow face barely visible. Ishmael and Queequeg stand beside him, their silhouettes framed by flickering lantern light, eyes narrowed with suspicion. The Pequod’s hulking hull looms in the background, its polished deck reflecting a faint moon glow. A heavy, storm‑clouded sky hangs overhead, casting long, ominous shadows over the scene—19th‑century oil painting, dark and moody."

    "image_prompt": "A lone, ragged sailor named Elijah strides across a mist‑laden harbor shore, his threadbare coat and patched trousers blending with the stormy sky. He glides past two bewildered figures—Ishmael in a coarse wool tunic and Queequeg with his carved wooden mask—who pause, eyes wide, as he moves unnoticed. The Pequod’s dark silhouette looms on the horizon, its sails furled against an ominous cloudscape. A somber, 19th‑century oil painting style captures the bleak mood, chiaroscuro lighting, and tension of unseen menace."

    "image_prompt": "A lone sailor in a dimly lit harbor pier, his back to the viewer, steps away from a darkened shore as a distant, ragged silhouette fades into mist. The moon casts long shadows over salt‑cracked stone and weathered wooden planks. Ishmael’s face is half‑lit by lantern light, eyes narrowed with relief; he turns one last glance at the vanished figure, murmuring “humbug” in a hushed breath. The scene is rendered as a moody, 19th‑century oil painting."
