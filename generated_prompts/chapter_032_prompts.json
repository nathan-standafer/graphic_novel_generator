    "image_prompt": "A moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism illustration of an ancient sea‑tavern in 19th‑century Nantucket, dimly lit by a single lantern, where weary whalemen—Captain Ahab, Ishmael, Queequeg, Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask—sit around a cracked wooden table. Their faces are lined with exhaustion; one holds a battered ledger marked “cash,” another clutches a weather‑worn sextant, while ash drifts in the smoky air, symbolizing “time, strength, cash, and patience.” Style: deep navy & charcoal tones, sharp chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain."
