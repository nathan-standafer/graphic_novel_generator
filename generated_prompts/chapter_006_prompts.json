    "image_prompt": "A twilight alley of New Bedford, soot‑stained cobblestones slick with rain, where a line of women in lace‑trimmed shawls stroll past weathered merchant houses; their pale faces glow with faint rose‑tinted blushes under the dim gaslight, yet each cheek retains a luminous, perpetual crimson as if kissed by celestial light. The scene is rendered in shadowy 19th‑century oil tones, moody chiaroscuro and muted earth hues, evoking a dark, brooding atmosphere of a maritime town at dusk."

    "image_prompt": "A dim, storm‑shadowed New Bedford street at dusk, fog curling over cobblestones. In the foreground, a group of elegant New England women in long, embroidered gowns stand amid a riot of crimson roses and violet carnations, their faces glowing with an almost ethereal light as if they were themselves blooming. Behind them, soot‑blackened warehouses loom, and a lone whaling ship’s silhouette looms on the harbor horizon. The scene is rendered as a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

    "image_prompt": "A dim, moody 19th‑century oil painting of a narrow Salem cobblestone lane at twilight, lanterns flickering on wrought‑iron posts. In the foreground, a cluster of young women—long black hair, simple white gowns—lean close together, their faces turned toward an unseen source of perfume; wisps of musk curl around them like faint incense clouds. Behind them, weathered clapboard houses loom, windows glowing with candlelight, while a distant ship’s silhouette hints at the sea‑bound town. The atmosphere is hushed, almost mystical, evoking the whispered scent of Salem’s youth."

    "image_prompt": "A dim, twilight street in New Bedford where a young woman in a coarse woolen dress leans over a cracked stone wall, her face turned toward the horizon. She inhales sharply as faint mist curls from distant salt‑sprayed waters, hinting at far‑off Moluccan spice groves rather than the flat Puritanic sands behind her. In the background, a lone figure—perhaps Ishmael in tattered sea coat—stands beside a weathered whaleboat, watching the gulls wheel above, all rendered in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style."
