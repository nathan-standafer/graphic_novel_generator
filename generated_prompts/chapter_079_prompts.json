    "image_prompt": "Ishmael stands on the creaking deck of the Pequod as a towering sperm whale’s massive head looms above the horizon, its broad, wrinkled brow dominating the sky. The foreboding navy sea roils under stark charcoal clouds; sharp chiaroscuro lights the whale’s immense forehead in dramatic contrast. In Romantic realism, fine linework blends with semi‑realistic gradients to capture the whale’s silent majesty and Ishmael’s awe, set in a 19th‑century whaling voyage."

    "image_prompt": "A lone figure on a battered whaleboat stands beneath a storm‑laden sky, the vast black silhouette of a sperm whale looming above. Ishmael’s face is illuminated by sharp chiaroscuro, his eyes fixed on the immense, wrinkled brow of the leviathan. Deep navy and charcoal tones dominate, with fine linework revealing the whale’s textured skin and subtle gradients giving depth to the turbulent sea. The mood is tense, Romantic realism in 19th‑century style, paper grain adding historic texture."
