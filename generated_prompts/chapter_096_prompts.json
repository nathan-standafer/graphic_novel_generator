    "image_prompt": "A solitary figure stands amid the smoky, iron‑clad triworks of the Pequod, hands gripping a weathered soapstone. The night sea roils in deep navy and charcoal, sharp chiaroscuro lighting casting long shadows over brass fittings and cracked wooden planks. Ahab’s silhouette looms in the background, eyes narrowed. The scene feels like 19th‑century Romantic realism: fine linework, semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain, capturing a tense, moody maritime moment."

    "image_prompt": "A solitary figure stands on the Pequod’s slick deck at midnight, surrounded by ghost‑like silhouettes of fallen sailors drifting like mist; the sea roils black beneath a stormy sky. His face is lit by flickering firelight from the triworks, eyes distant as if seeing through the veil between life and death. The ship creaks, waves crash, and a faint spectral choir whispers—capturing the eerie calm of “living in the congregation of the dead.” Romantic realism, 19th‑century nautical drama, navy/charcoal chiaroscuro, fine linework with semi‑realistic gradients."

    "image_prompt": "A solitary figure in a dimly lit ship’s galley stands before roaring triwork furnaces, their face illuminated by harsh red flames that cast long shadows across cracked stone and iron bracing. Smoke curls like black serpents, choking the air; the man’s eyes are wide with terror as he feels the heat “invert” his spirit. The scene is rendered in Romantic realism, deep navy and charcoal tones, sharp chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain—19th‑century whaling voyage."

    "image_prompt": "A moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism illustration set aboard the Pequod at midnight: a dark, charcoal‑toned deck lit by sharp chiaroscuro from the glowing triworks, flames curling like Greek fire. Captain Ahab stands in silhouette, eyes reflecting fiery heat, while Ishmael and Stubb watch over the furnace. The scene captures the paradox of woe and madness—an eagle soaring unseen above stormy waters—evoking 19th‑century whaling tension in deep navy and charcoal hues."

    "image_prompt": "A lone figure—perhaps a harpooner or Ahab—soars above jagged, moonlit cliffs of the Pequod’s deck, wings stretched wide over storm‑swept waves. The sea below roils in deep navy and charcoal, with sharp chiaroscuro lighting casting long shadows across the ship’s timber. In the foreground a towering mountain silhouette looms, its peaks piercing the night sky, while distant birds glide on faint wisps of mist, emphasizing the hero’s solitary flight above all. Romantic realism, 19th‑century maritime style."
