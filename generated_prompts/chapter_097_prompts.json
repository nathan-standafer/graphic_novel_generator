    "segment_text": "Chapter 97 The Lamp Had you descended from the Pequod's Triworks to the Pequod's Forecastle, where the off-duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counselors.",
    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit Pequod forecastle at night: a lone figure descending from the Triworks, lantern in hand, revealing sleeping watchmen beneath vaulted oaken beams. The scene glows with sharp chiaroscuro, deep navy and charcoal tones; fine linework meets semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain accentuating tension. Romantic realism of 19th‑century whaling voyage, emphasizing the solitary, illuminated shrine‑like hush amid the ship’s dark hull."

    "image_prompt": "A dim fore‑castle of the Pequod, lanterns casting sharp, navy‑black shadows across rough oaken vaults. Nine stout sailors lie in slumped repose, their hooded faces illuminated by flickering amber lamps that glow like miniature moons. The chiaroscuro light highlights every sinew and scar; fine linework outlines weathered coats while subtle paper grain gives texture to the sea‑salt air, capturing a 19th‑century whaling ship’s moody, Romantic realism."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit foredeck at night on a 19th‑century whaling ship, smoke curling from a single lantern. The crew lie in triangular oaken vaults, heads bowed under flickering oil lamps. A solitary sailor—tanned, rugged—holds a battered glass bottle, eyes reflecting the glow of his lamp, as he contemplates the scarcity of oil compared to royal milk. Moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism with deep navy and charcoal tones, chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit fore‑castle of the Pequod at night, rugged sailors wrapped in tattered coats, hunched over small lanterns that glow with soft amber. The air hums with the scent of oil and sweat; a lone mariner clutches a flickering lamp, his eyes reflecting the wavering light as he staggers toward a meager meal on a wooden crate. Moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism in deep navy and charcoal tones, chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain, 19th‑century whaling voyage style."

    "image_prompt": "A lone whaler stands beneath a low, iron lantern on the Pequod’s foredeck at night, his silhouette illuminated by a single, flickering flame. He holds a small oil lamp aloft, its glow reflecting off the ship’s polished hull and the dark sea beyond. The scene is rendered in Romantic realism, 19th‑century maritime style, with deep navy and charcoal tones, sharp chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain."

    "image_prompt": "A dim, moody illustration of a 19th‑century whaling ship’s foredeck at night: a lone mariner—perhaps Ishmael—placing a glowing Aladdin lamp against the black hull, its lantern light spilling across worn wooden planks and storm‑etched sails. The scene is in Romantic realism with deep navy and charcoal tones, sharp chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain, capturing tense nautical solitude."

The oil glows like molten amber, its pure scent rising in the cold air. Shadows dance across the wooden deck and the sleeping crew below; only the steady burn reveals the quiet ritual.
