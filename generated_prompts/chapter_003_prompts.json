    "image_prompt": "A dim, low‑arched entry of a weathered tavern, its wainscots scarred by salt and age. In the center hangs a heavily defaced oil canvas: a battered Cape Horner in a storm, three broken masts, an impaled whale head looming over shattered rigging, all shrouded in swirling black gloom. Beside it, grotesque weapons—rusted harpoons, jagged spear‑heads studded with human hair—line the wall like sacrificial offerings. In the dim glow of tallow candles, a rugged landlord leans on an ancient barrel, while rough‑skinned seamen, coats flapping, clutch mugs of bitter ale. The scene is rendered in brooding 19th‑century oil style, with heavy chiaroscuro and muted, earthy tones."
