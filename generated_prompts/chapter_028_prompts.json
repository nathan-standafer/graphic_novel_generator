    "segment_text": "But the Pequod was only making a passage now, not regularly cruising, nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite Ahab now and thus chase away.",
    "image_prompt": "A dim, storm‑laden deck of the Pequod in a twilight sea, Captain Ahab standing alone in a skeletal pivot hole, his ivory leg steady against the wood; below him, the competent mates busy with whaling gear and charts, their faces lit by lantern glow. The ship’s hull groans, waves crash, yet Ahab remains detached, eyes fixed ahead, as the crew labor in subdued, brooding oil‑painted gloom. Dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

    "image_prompt": "A dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting of Captain Ahab standing rigidly on the Pequod’s quarterdeck, his weather‑scarred face turned toward a stormy sky. Thick, layered clouds press heavily upon his broad brow, as if gathering on an unseen mountain peak, while the sea roils beneath and the crew watches in hushed awe. The atmosphere is tense, foreboding, and richly textured."

    "image_prompt": "A somber, storm‑laden quarterdeck of the Pequod under a brooding sky, Captain Ahab stands rigid in his pivot hole, ivory leg resting against the plank, eyes fixed ahead. The crew watches from below; Ishmael and Starbuck tense beside him. Light filters through heavy clouds, hinting at an incoming warm holiday breeze that softens Ahab’s grim visage—dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

    "segment_text": "For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods, even the barest, ruggedest, most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants.",
    "image_prompt": "Ahab stands on the Pequod’s quarterdeck at dawn, his bronze‑like frame silhouetted against a bruised sky; faint green shoots of hope sprout from a weather‑scarred oak amid swirling storm clouds, echoing spring’s return. His ivory leg rests in an auger hole, while Ishmael watches, torn between awe and dread. The scene evokes a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting of reluctant renewal at sea."

    "image_prompt": "Ahab, bronze‑tanned and scarred, stands on the Pequod’s quarterdeck under bruised clouds, his ivory leg hidden in a plank hole. The sea roils, wind rattles rigging; the crew watches with wary eyes. A faint, reluctant smile flickers across Ahab’s grim face as he briefly lifts his gaze toward a distant, sunlit horizon—softening the ship’s relentless gloom. Dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

    "image_prompt": "Dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting: Captain Ahab stands on the Pequod’s quarterdeck beneath storm‑laden clouds, his bronze‑like frame and scarred white leg imposing. He gazes out over the gray sea, yet his eyes flicker with a fleeting, almost tender smile—an unexpected blossom of warmth in a man forged by relentless pursuit, captured in somber, dramatic brushwork."
