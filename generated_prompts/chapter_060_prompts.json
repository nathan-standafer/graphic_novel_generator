    "image_prompt": "Whale‑boat at dusk, a thin line of manila spiraling like a serpent around oarsmen’s bodies, their faces tense under harsh lantern light. The sea churns in dark navy and charcoal, shadows clashing with sharp chiaroscuro. In the center, an unseen harpoon tip glints ominously, hinting imminent doom. The crew’s strained silhouettes echo silent peril, captured in Romantic realism with fine linework, semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain, 19th‑century nautical drama."

    "segment_text": "And, if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than those seated before your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side.",
    "image_prompt": "A solitary whaleboat rocking on midnight waves, its crew tangled in thick whale line that snakes like coiled serpents around oarsmen’s limbs. In the dim lantern glow, a lone philosopher sits, hands resting on his chest, eyes reflecting the flickering firelight—yet his face bears no terror, only quiet contemplation. The scene evokes 19th‑century whaling tension, moody navy and charcoal tones, sharp chiaroscuro, Romantic realism with fine linework and subtle paper grain."
