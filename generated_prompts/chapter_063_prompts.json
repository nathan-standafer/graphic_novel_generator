    "image_prompt": "Illustrate the cramped interior of a 19th‑century whaling brig’s gunwale: a two‑foot notched stick (the “crotch”) protrudes from the starboard side near the bow, its wooden face holding a gleaming harpoon barbed end poised for quick draw. Sharp chiaroscuro lighting casts deep navy shadows across rusted brass fittings and worn leather straps, while fine linework reveals the tension of sailors preparing to strike a massive whale. Romantic realism, 1800s nautical era."

A frantic harpooner—arms flailing with lightning speed—reaches for the second iron, but the creature’s convulsive surge throws him off balance, leaving the second sharp spear dangling ominously over the ship’s railing.
