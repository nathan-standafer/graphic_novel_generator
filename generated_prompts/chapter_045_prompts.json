    "image_prompt": "A lone, weather‑worn scholar sits amid towering stacks of leather‑bound tomes and flickering candlelight, quill poised over a parchment. His face is lit by sharp chiaroscuro, deep navy shadows framing the earnest expression that conveys “most trustworthy, unexaggerating.” The scene is rendered in Romantic realism with fine linework, semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain, evoking 19th‑century scholarly gravitas."

    "image_prompt": "A moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism illustration of an ancient Mediterranean seascape: a stormy black sea under charcoal skies, a massive shadowed whale prowling near the shore of Propontis, its dorsal fin breaking the waves like a dark spear.
