    "image_prompt": "A dramatic, high‑contrast illustration in Romantic realism (19th‑century style) shows two colossal whale heads side by side: a right whale with a broad, rounded skull and smooth dorsal ridge, no teeth or long mandible; beside it, a sperm whale’s sharp, narrow jaw filled with ivory teeth. Deep navy and charcoal tones, chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain, capture the stark contrast of their anatomy on a stormy deck."

    "image_prompt": "A lone sperm whale’s massive head rises from midnight‑blue ocean, its smooth, scarred forehead and single spout illuminated by stark chiaroscuro light. The absence of bone blinds, a huge lower lip, or a prominent tongue is emphasized: the jaw is thin, the mouth cavity shallow, revealing only faint scars. In Romantic realism, deep navy and charcoal tones clash with sharp linework and subtle gradients, evoking 19th‑century whaling tension on paper grain."

Sharp chiaroscuro lighting casts the creature’s rugged skin into dramatic shadows, while fine linework blends with semi‑realistic gradients to reveal barnacled crown and scimitar‑shaped bone blinds. Subtle paper grain adds texture, evoking a 19th‑century whaling voyage."
