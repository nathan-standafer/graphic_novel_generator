    "image_prompt": "Three rugged harpooneers—Queequeg, Tashtego, and Dugg—rise from the cabin table, their broad shoulders shaking with each stride as they depart toward the deck. Their boots clang against wood, rattling like Moorish scimitars in scabbards, echoing across the ship’s hull. The scene is rendered as a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting, heavy with muted light and deep shadows, capturing the tense, almost mythic departure of these salt‑sea warriors."

    "image_prompt": "A dim, storm‑lit cabin aboard the Pequod, its worn wooden walls veiled in shadow; a small, ragged table set for three harpooneers—Queequeg, Tashtego, and Dagu—whose faces are gaunt, scarred, and fierce. They rise, cloaked in coarse furs, passing through the narrow doorway into their cramped, dimly lit quarters, leaving a trail of broken cutlery and flickering lantern light.

    "image_prompt": "A dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting: Captain Ahab stands alone in the dimly lit cabin, his weathered face illuminated by a single lantern. The cramped interior is lined with heavy oak panels and sparse furnishings—an iron stove, a cracked table, and scattered charts. Beside him, Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask appear as shadowy figures peering from corners, their faces etched with resignation. The atmosphere conveys Ahab’s solitary authority and the implied exile of his crew to the open deck, all rendered in rich oil textures."

Captain Ahab sits rigidly at a scarred wooden table, his silhouette stark against flickering lantern light. Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask are hunched over plates of steaming beef, their faces pale under the harsh glow. Queequeg’s carved loincloth hangs beside a jagged knife; a battered steward clutches a chipped bowl. The air is heavy with salt and silence, a moody 19th‑century oil painting."
