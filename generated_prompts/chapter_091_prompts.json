    "image_prompt": "A moody Romantic‑realism illustration of Stubb standing on the Pequod’s deck amid a swirling, vapourous sea, his spade poised over a rotting whale carcass. The scene is bathed in deep navy and charcoal tones with sharp chiaroscuro lighting; fine linework blends into semi‑realistic gradients, capturing the grim, high‑contrast tension of a 19th‑century whaling voyage. A faint ambergris glinting beneath the wrecked flesh hints at the treasure he can “easily dent” with his thumb."

    "image_prompt": "A moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism illustration set aboard the Pequod in 19th‑century whaling era. Show Stubb’s spade striking the gray‑white belly of a dead whale, revealing a yellow‑ash colored core of ambergris glimmering like dried honey amid swirling black smoke and distant gulls. Sharp chiaroscuro highlights Stubb’s weathered face, the ship’s dark hull, and the faint perfume trail rising from the carcass, capturing tension and discovery."

    "image_prompt": "A storm‑lit deck of the Pequod, with Captain Ahab’s stern silhouette looming over a roiling sea, as Stubb triumphantly holds up a glistening ambergris lump in his hand, surrounded by grizzled whalers clutching cutlasses and battered nets. The air is thick with salt and musk; distant gulls cry against the navy twilight. Romantic realism, high‑contrast chiaroscuro, 19th‑century maritime detail, deep navy and charcoal tones."

    "segment_text": "Some six handfuls were obtained, but more was unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for impatient Ahab's loud command to stub to desist and come on board, else the ship would bid them goodbye.",
    "image_prompt": "A storm‑laden deck of the Pequod, moonlit navy waves crashing against wooden hulls, Stubb in a battered skiff hauling ambergris from a rotting whale’s belly, his hands clutching yellow‑ash globes of treasure. Behind him, Ahab looms on the quarterdeck, eyes blazing with impatience, shouting to halt the dig. The scene throbs with chiaroscuro shadows, fine linework and subtle paper grain, evoking 19th‑century Romantic realism in deep navy and charcoal tones."
