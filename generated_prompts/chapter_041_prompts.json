    "image_prompt": "Skiff tied to a massive 19th‑century whaling ship, its wooden hull creaking against the rough sea; Ahab’s stern silhouette looms in the gloom, his eyes fixed on the horizon where a white whale glides. Dark navy waves crash against charcoal‑tinted sails, sharp chiaroscuro light highlights the crew’s tense faces. Romantic realism style, 1800s maritime era, moody, high‑contrast illustration with subtle paper grain."

    "image_prompt": "A lone figure—Ishmael—stands on the creaking deck of the Pequod, wind whipping his coat, eyes fixed on a distant gray horizon where a colossal white whale glides beneath storm‑dark waters. The scene is drenched in deep navy and charcoal, sharp chiaroscuro lighting casting long shadows over the ship’s rigging. Fine linework blends with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain adding texture, evoking 19th‑century whaling tension in a moody Romantic realism style."
