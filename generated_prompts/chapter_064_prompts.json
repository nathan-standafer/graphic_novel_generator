    "image_prompt": "Night‑time deck of the Pequod, deep navy and charcoal sea, moonlit waves reflected in sharp chiaroscuro. Captain Ahab stands tall, hand outstretched, voice booming “Away you sail then.” Around him, crew—Stubb, Starbuck, Flask—loom in silhouette, lanterns flickering, a whale’s massive carcass moored beside the ship. Romantic realism, 19th‑century whaling voyage style, fine linework with semi‑realistic gradients and subtle paper grain."

    "image_prompt": "A dim night‑deck of the Pequod, a hulking black sperm whale’s fluked body lying against the ship, its ribs glinting in lantern light. Old Fleece, tongs in hand, shouts “Haloa” to the startled cook, who clutches a battered skillet. Sharks ripple beneath the water, their jaws flashing. Ahab watches from the bow, silhouette against navy‑black sky, chiaroscuro shadows deepening the tense, Romantic realism scene."

    "image_prompt": "A somber night on the Pequod’s deck: the hulking dead whale lies tethered beside the ship, chains clanking in moonlit gloom. Captain Ahab stands amid the dim lantern glow, his face gaunt and resolute, as he shouts “Avast, heaving again.” Nearby Stubb and other crew wrestle with heavy lines, while a lone shark circles the carcass, its jaws dripping. The scene is rendered in moody Romantic realism, navy‑charcoal chiaroscuro, fine linework, semi‑realistic gradients, paper grain, 19th‑century maritime style."

    "image_prompt": "A moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism illustration of the Pequod’s deck at night, deep navy and charcoal tones with sharp chiaroscuro lighting. The scene shows Captain Ahab in his dark coat, grinning mischievously as he points toward a pile of gleaming whale balls on a wooden table beside the capstan. Lanterns cast flickering light over the polished wood, while shadowy silhouettes of sharks lurk below the hull, hinting at the beast’s lingering presence. 19th‑century nautical detail."

    "image_prompt": "A moonlit Pequod deck, dark navy waves crashing, a massive white sperm whale’s black hull draped beside the ship, chains clinking against its flukes. Captain Ahab stands in shadowed rigging, lantern light flickering over his gaunt face as he mutters “Wish by gore, whale eat him, stead of him eat whale.” Stubb and other crew loom in charcoal silhouettes, their eyes reflecting trembling fear. Romantic realism, high‑contrast chiaroscuro, 19th‑century nautical gloom."

    "image_prompt": "A lone black cook, gaunt and weather‑worn, stands on the Pequod’s aft deck as night swallows the sea. He mutters a cryptic curse about “Sharkdan Massashark,” his voice ragged, then limps toward the ship’s cramped hammock, shuffling over rope and splintered wood. The scene is moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism in deep navy and charcoal tones, sharp chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain—19th‑century whaling voyage."
