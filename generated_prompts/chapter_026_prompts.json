    "segment_text": "If, then, to meanest mariners And renegades and castaways, I shall hereafter Ascribe high qualities, though dark we round them, Tragic races, if even the most mournful, Perchance the most abased among them all, Shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts, Malts, if I shall touch that workman's arm With some ethereal light, if it shall spread a rainbow Over his disastrous set of sun, then, Mane as all mortal critics, bear me out in it, Thou just spirit of equality, which hast spread One royal mantle of humanity over all my kind",
    "image_prompt": "A dim, storm‑clouded harbor at dusk, the Pequod’s battered hull looming amid a scattering of ragged castaways and weary seamen—Starbuck in sober gray, Stubb in weathered tan, a lone renegade with a tattered coat. A faint ethereal glow rises from a worker’s arm, casting a subtle rainbow across the wavering sea, while a distant lighthouse flickers. The scene exudes 19th‑century oil painting gloom, yet hints of hope and equality shine through the dark waters. Art style: dark, moody, 19th‑century oil painting."

    "segment_text": "Bear me out in it, thou great democratic god, Who didst not refuse to the sweet convict, Bunyan, the pale poetic pearl, Thou who didst clove with doubly hammered leaves Of finest gold, the stumped and poppered arm Of old Cervantes.",
    "image_prompt": "A lone figure—Starbuck—stands alone in the dim, cramped galley of the Pequod, a single flickering lantern casting long shadows on weathered wooden beams. He grips a tattered Bible, his face illuminated by candlelight as he mutters an impassioned prayer to a “great democratic god,” invoking biblical and literary heroes. The scene is rendered in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style, with heavy chiaroscuro, thick impasto strokes, and a muted, stormy palette."

    "segment_text": "Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles, Who didst hurl him upon a war-horse, Who didst thunder him higher than a throne, Thou who, in all thy mighty earthly marchings, Ever cullest thy selectest champions from the kingly commons, Bar me out in it, O God!",
    "image_prompt": "A tempestuous seascape at dusk, a towering dark cloud swirling above the Pequod’s mast, an enormous, unseen divine hand emerging from the storm, grasping a weary, armored man (symbolizing Andrew Jackson) from jagged rocks and thrusting him onto a thunderous war‑horse that surges forward. The scene is rendered in chiaroscuro 19th‑century oil style, with deep shadows, muted earth tones, and dramatic light illuminating the hand’s ethereal glow against the swirling waves. Art style: dark, moody, 19th‑century oil painting."
