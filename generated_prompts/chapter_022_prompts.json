    "image_prompt": "A storm‑laden deck at night: Captain Peleg, a weathered sea‑roving figure in tattered coat, forces his weary companion Bildad over the slick wooden rail into a battered oar‑boat. The moon casts long shadows across the splintered hull, while wind howls through rigging and waves crash against iron bulwarks. In the foreground, their gaunt faces reveal grim resolve; the background shows a dimly lit harbor with fog swirling around lanterns. Render in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style."

    "image_prompt": "A dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting of the Pequod’s quarter‑deck at midnight: a hulking wooden hull and a smaller boat split apart, their decks slick with rainwater. A lone gull soars above, wings spread against a stormy sky, while a chilling night breeze ripples through tattered sails and billowing rope. Shadows cast by lanterns flicker on rough planks, evoking the tense, isolated moment of departure in cold Atlantic darkness. 19th‑century oil painting style."

    "segment_text": "The two hulls wildly rolled, we gave three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged, like fate, into the lone Atlantic.",
    "image_prompt": "Two battered hulls sway violently in a moon‑lit Atlantic, their decks splashed with frothy spray; crew in tattered coats raise clenched fists and shout grim cheers into the stormy wind. In the foreground, Captain Peleg and Bildad, faces weathered and eyes gleaming, stare toward the horizon as the Pequod’s black sails billow against a bruised sky. The scene is rendered in dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style, emphasizing muted tones, dramatic chiaroscuro, and a sense of inevitable fate."
