In a low‑candle glow sits Procopius, robed in simple drapery, quill poised over a rolled parchment, eyes narrowed with sober scrutiny. Shelves of scrolls loom behind him; a faint, smoky haze suggests the distant roar of sea monsters he has chronicled. The atmosphere is heavy, contemplative, evoking a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style."
