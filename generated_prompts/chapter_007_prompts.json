    "image_prompt": "Ishmael stands alone beside a cracked stone altar, his ragged jacket flapping in a howling sleet‑mist that pours through the chapel’s high windows. The dim candlelight flickers across worn marble tablets bearing names of lost sailors, their black borders stark against the gloom. Queequeg, silent and wary, watches from a pew. Ishmael raises one hand, his voice echoing in the hushed hall: “Take it, I say, it is not me.” The scene feels like a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit whaleman’s chapel in storm‑swept New Bedford, a lone congregation of weary sailors and widows gathered around marble tablets etched with names of lost mates. Queequeg stands beside Ishmael, eyes reflecting the flickering candlelight as he raises a silent toast to Nantucket, his voice swallowed by the wind outside. The scene is rendered in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style, heavy shadows and muted earth tones capturing melancholy reverence."

    "image_prompt": "A dim, storm‑shrouded New Bedford chapel interior, 19th‑century oil style, with heavy velvet drapes and flickering candlelight. In the foreground, a weary Ishmael in a ragged bearskin coat sits on a pew, his face illuminated by a lone lantern, eyes fixed on cold marble tablets etched with names of lost sailors. Beside him, Queequeg stands tall, a silent observer, his beard catching the weak glow. The air is heavy with mist and distant thunder, evoking a dark, moody atmosphere that mirrors Ishmael’s inner lament about mortality and destiny."
