    "image_prompt": "A moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism illustration of a weathered blacksmith’s grave in a dimly lit 19th‑century shipboard churchyard: a granite gravestone etched with “T.H.Y.” under a stormy navy sky, surrounded by skeletal crows and tattered sea‑cloth. The blacksmith, gaunt and bowed, stands beside it, eyes hollow yet resolute, as the distant whaleboat’s silhouette glints on the horizon. Chiaroscuro lighting emphasizes salt‑salted sea spray and the ship’s worn deck in subtle charcoal tones—19th‑century maritime atmosphere."

    "image_prompt": "A moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism illustration of an old blacksmith’s weathered face lit by sharp chiaroscuro beneath a stormy navy sky. He stands on a ship deck, hammer in hand, his soul depicted as a faint, swirling spectral light echoing from east to west, sunrise to sunset. The scene captures the tension of a 19th‑century whaling voyage, with deep charcoal tones and subtle paper grain. Style: Romantic realism, 1800s maritime."

    "image_prompt": "Perth the weary blacksmith, gaunt and wind‑tossed, staggers onto the deck of Ahab’s whaling ship, his cracked back bowed under the weight of years. He raises a battered hammer, its clang echoing against the iron hull, then lets out a mournful wail that ripples over the creaking rigging. Dark navy sky swallows the sound; charcoal clouds swirl around the ship’s silhouette, all rendered in Romantic realism with high‑contrast chiaroscuro and subtle paper grain."
