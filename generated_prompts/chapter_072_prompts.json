    "image_prompt": "Aunt Charity aboard the Pequod, a stout woman in tattered navy uniform, stands beside a cracked wooden crate of steaming ginger‑spiced tea, her hand gripping a ragged mug labeled “Ginger‑Jub.” She gestures sternly toward a weary harpooner, Queequeg, who leans against a canvas rope, eyes wary. The deck is dark, waves lashing below, with the ship’s lanterns casting sharp chiaroscuro shadows—Romantic realism, 19th‑century whaling, deep navy and charcoal tones."

Stubb, rough‑eyed, holds a steaming cup of ginger‑jub toward Queequeg, who leans over the whale’s carcass, his broad canvas belt taut with the monkey rope. The crew watches in shadow; sharp chiaroscuro highlights the rippling water and flaring lanterns.
