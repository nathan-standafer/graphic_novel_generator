    "image_prompt": "A dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting: in a dimly lit bar‑room, Queequeg sits at the head of a worn wooden breakfast table surrounded by grizzled whalemen. He ignores steaming coffee and fresh rolls, eyes fixed on a rare beefsteak before him. His harpoon lies casually beside his plate, a silent reminder of the sea. The room hums with hushed tension; other sailors stare at him like wary sheep, their faces half‑masked by beards and sweat. Queequeg’s calm, icicle‑cool demeanor contrasts sharply with the rough, sun‑tanned crew, creating an eerie tableau of quiet defiance amid a bustling, smoky tavern atmosphere."

    "image_prompt": "A dim, candlelit public room in a 19th‑century coastal tavern, painted in heavy oil strokes with deep shadows and muted earth tones. In the center, Queequeg sits alone at a worn wooden table, his broad chestnut beard and scarred hands gripping a thick slice of rare steak with reverence. A flickering tomahawk pipe rests in his palm as he lifts it to light, smoke curling upward against a backdrop of peeling plaster walls and faded maritime maps. His inseparable hat sits on the floor beside him, hinting at quiet solitude after a bustling breakfast. The scene exudes a moody, somber atmosphere, capturing the solitary ritual of a seasoned whaleman in twilight gloom."
