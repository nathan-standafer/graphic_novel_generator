    "image_prompt": "A somber, 19th‑century oil painting of a battered Pequod’s deck under stormy sky, waves crashing against its hull as weary crew in tattered sailcloth scramble aboard. Captain Ahab stands at the prow, eyes fixed forward, while Queequeg and Starbuck cling to railings, their faces pale with exhaustion. The sea roils like blackened oil, a lone lantern glows faintly amid the wreckage, evoking despair and desperate salvation. Dark, moody atmosphere."

    "image_prompt": "A dim twilight over a storm‑laden sea, the Pequod’s deck shrouded in thick fog. In the foreground, the four skiff crews—tiger‑yellow Manillas and Ahab’s fierce crew—are depicted mid‑row, their oars splashing against churning waves. Above, dark clouds gather as a squall approaches; the ship’s silhouette looms, its men hurriedly hauling in their boats with weathered hands, all rendered in brooding 19th‑century oil style."

    "image_prompt": "A lone, battered whaling vessel drifts ominously across a storm‑tossed sea, its hull scarred and sails torn, yet still cutting through the dark waves with grim determination. A small group of desperate sailors cling to a broken oar, their faces gaunt and eyes wild, as they stare at the distant ship that has abandoned them. The scene is rendered in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style."

    "image_prompt": "A lone figure stands on a storm‑swept deck, the wind whipping his blackened jacket and turban. Captain Ahab, tall and gaunt, leans forward with one arm outstretched, eyes narrowed in fierce determination. He shouts “Ah!” as waves crash against the hull, casting a pallid, moonlit glow over the sea. The scene is rendered in dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style, emphasizing heavy shadows and brooding atmosphere."
