    "image_prompt": "A tempestuous ocean roils beneath a bruised sky, as an array of fantastical leviathans breach: a pudding‑headed whale with a round belly, a cape‑shrouded beast in shadow, the proud leading whale glinting silver; a cannon‑whale rattling like gunfire, a scraggy creature flapping its ragged fins, a copper‑tinted giant glimmering in moonlight. Nearby, an elephantine whale thunders, a sugrock sprouting spines, and a Pewdie‑quag‑glill spirals into the mist—an eerie, mythic choir of sea monsters. The scene is rendered as a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

    "segment_text": "From Icelandic, Dutch, and Old English authorities there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names, but I admit them as altogether obsolete, and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of leviathanism, with signifying nothing.",
    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit, candle‑lit study in a 19th‑century ship’s galley, where an aged whaleman scrolls through tattered Icelandic and Dutch manuscripts. He leans over a cracked oak desk, his face illuminated by flickering oil lamps, eyes narrowed as he dismisses obscure whale names like “lewiathanism” with a weary sigh. The background shows maps of the North Atlantic, ghostly sea charts, and a weathered globe, all rendered in moody, shadowy 19th‑century oil painting style."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit study of an elderly sea‑whale scholar, hunched over a cracked wooden desk littered with tattered scrolls and half‑finished charts of whales. He holds a quill poised above a page, his face shadowed by the flickering candle flame, eyes weary yet resolute. In the background a towering, unfinished stone cathedral looms, its spire broken mid‑rise, symbolizing the incomplete taxonomy. The scene is rendered in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style."

    "image_prompt": "A solitary, ink‑darkened study on a stormy sea‑night, where an elderly whaleman hunched over a battered wooden desk scrolls through tattered whale charts and inked notes; his weathered face illuminated by the flickering glow of a single oil lamp, eyes fixed on a massive, half‑eclipsed portrait of a colossal sperm whale hanging above. The room is steeped in soot and salt, with cracked plaster walls and a faint smell of brine. A sense of solemn oath hangs heavy in the air—dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

    "image_prompt": "A lone scholar hunched over a battered desk strewn with yellowed maps and half‑finished charts, his quill paused mid‑stroke as he turns from the page. Outside the cracked window, the dark silhouette of Cologne’s unfinished cathedral looms, its towering spire broken by a rusted crane still perched at the top. Candlelight flickers across the scene, casting long shadows that mingle with the looming stone structure, all rendered in a grim, 19th‑century oil painting style."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit 19th‑century shipyard at dusk, oil paint with deep shadows and muted earth tones. In the foreground a small wooden pier is being completed: an apprentice hands the final stone to a seasoned master builder—his silhouette framed by lantern light. The master’s hand rests on the cornerstone, symbolizing legacy, while faint outlines of grander structures loom in the mist beyond, hinting at future monuments. Dark, moody atmosphere emphasizes perseverance and timeless craftsmanship. Art style: dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

He gazes at a tattered atlas of whales, its pages scattered with faded sketches of Husa and Mealy Mouth porpoises. A flickering oil lamp casts deep shadows across the cramped study, walls lined with brass sextants and weathered logbooks. The air is heavy with salt‑mold and regret; the narrator’s voice echoes: “God keep me from ever completing anything,” as if the unfinished parchment were a cursed relic. Dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

Through a grimy window, a bleak ocean roils under thunderclouds, hinting at the unfinished voyage. The scene feels mournful, echoing “this whole book is but a draft, nay, but the draft of a draft.”"

The sea churns beneath, waves reflecting a muted moon. The scene is rendered in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style, emphasizing shadow and textured brushwork."
