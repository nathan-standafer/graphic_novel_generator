    "image_prompt": "A lone sailor in a tattered wool coat strides through a snow‑clad New Bedford street at midnight, the lantern of a dim inn flickering like a dying candle. Frost clings to cobblestones, and the air is thick with cold and the distant creak of a docked ship’s timbers. He raises his hand in farewell to an empty tavern door, declaring “no more blubbering.” The background shows a grimy harbor, a black‑painted wharf, and a looming silhouette of a Nantucket sloop against a bruised sky. A somber, 19th‑century oil painting style captures the bleak mood, muted palette, and the heavy, oppressive atmosphere of impending whaling adventure."

    "image_prompt": "A lone wanderer in New Bedford’s bleak December night scrapes frost from his boots beside a sagging wooden inn, its swinging sign bearing a ghostly mist spray. The street is dim, snow piled high, the sea’s cold wind howling through cracked windows. In the foreground, the traveler—his face half-shadowed, eyes reflecting icy determination—leans over a chipped stone step, his hand gripping a battered coat sleeve. Behind him, a lone lantern casts wavering light on the cracked pavement and the distant harbor silhouette. The scene is rendered in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style, with muted blues, grays, and deep shadows emphasizing isolation and foreboding."
