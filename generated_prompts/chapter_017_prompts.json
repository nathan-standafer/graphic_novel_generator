    "image_prompt": "A dim, candlelit cabin on a storm‑laden ship, its wooden beams scarred by age. Captain Ahab’s weathered face leans over a battered table, his hand clutching a cracked compass; beside him, Ishmael in tattered breeches looks solemnly at Queequeg, who sits hunched on the floor with his harpoon propped against his chest, eyes distant and unblinking. The air is thick with tension as Ahab’s voice echoes, “No more, Queequeg…that will do.” Shadows loom over their faces, capturing a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting atmosphere."

    "image_prompt": "A dim lantern-lit study in a cramped ship cabin, where an aged sailor leans over a cracked wooden table, his weathered face illuminated by the flickering flame as he recounts to a listening Ishmael the island tradition that follows a great victory—victorious warriors are honored with a grand feast. The room hums with hushed reverence, shadows pooling on rough timber, evoking a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit, twilight courtyard of a grand colonial estate, where a victorious captain’s men gather around large, soot‑blackened wooden trenchers laden with roasted carcasses. The air is heavy with the scent of burnt bread-fruit, toasted coconuts, and fragrant parsley specks. A lone lantern casts wavering shadows on the polished stone floor as a proud commander hands out these lavish “turkeys” to his comrades, smiling like a festive host amid an eerie, somber 19th‑century oil painting style."

    "image_prompt": "A dim, candlelit cabin on a storm‑laden sea, Ishmael standing beside Queequeg who sits rigidly on the floor, his back to Ishmael. Queequeg’s expression is blank and unresponsive, ears closed to the speaker’s words. Ishmael leans forward, animated, gesturing with his hand as if explaining complex ideas that fall on deaf ears. The wooden deck outside shows waves crashing; a faint glow from lanterns casts long shadows across the room. Dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style."

    "image_prompt": "A dimly lit cabin aboard the Pequod at twilight, its wooden beams scarred by years of sea spray. In the center, Queequeg sits stoically on a rickety chair, his face illuminated by a single flickering lantern, eyes narrowed in quiet conviction. Beside him, Ishmael leans forward, hands clasped, listening intently as Queequeg’s expression radiates self‑assured reverence. The air is heavy with salt and incense, the mood tense yet solemn—an austere 19th‑century oil painting of steadfast belief amid maritime gloom."

Queequeg, broad‑shouldered and scarred, sits stoically on a cracked floor board, his eyes fixed upon Ishmael who leans forward, listening. The old harpoon rests beside him, its iron shaft gleaming faintly in the gloom. Queequeg’s gaze is a mixture of pity and solemnity, as though he mourns Ishmael’s misplaced faith, in a dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting style."

Ishmael and Queequeg, eyes weary from fasting, rise together amid scattered bowls of steaming chowder, their faces illuminated by flickering oil lamps. The landlady’s austere silhouette looms in the doorway, her purse heavy with coins. Outside, the Pequod’s hulking hull glows under a stormy sky as the men step onto its deck, halibut bones clutched for teeth‑cleaning. Dark, moody 19th‑century oil painting."
