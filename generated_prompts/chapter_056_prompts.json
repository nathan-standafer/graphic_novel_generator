    "image_prompt": "A cramped deck of a 19th‑century Nantucket whaler at dusk, the polished bronze harpoons and gleaming iron lances arrayed in a neat line across worn oak planks; sailors in dark navy coats pause, eyes fixed on the looming sperm whale’s slick black back off‑screen. Sharp chiaroscuro casts deep shadows over weathered rigging, while fine linework blends into semi‑realistic gradients of charcoal and midnight blue, evoking the tense anticipation of a Romantic realism illustration."

    "image_prompt": "Three oarsmen set a mast into its hole as a small whaleboat suddenly rolls upright, half‑erect in the churning sea like a rearing horse. The scene is a moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism illustration from the 19th century, deep navy and charcoal tones, sharp chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain capturing tense whaling drama."

    "segment_text": "From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies, and to windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.",
    "image_prompt": "A moody, high‑contrast Romantic realism illustration of the Pequod’s deck amid a violent storm: thick black clouds loom windward, crackling with lightning; from the ship’s mast a billowing plume of smoke rises like forge smoke, swirling over boiling water. Excited seamen—Captain Ahab, Starbuck, Stubb, Flask—clutch oars and harpoons, eyes wide, faces tense. Deep navy and charcoal tones dominate, chiaroscuro lighting dramatizes the roaring sea, 19th‑century whaling scene."
