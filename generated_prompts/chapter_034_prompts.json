    "image_prompt": "A solitary figure—Captain Ahab—stands alone on a moonlit deck, his silhouette stark against a storm‑black sky, hand gripping a worn harpoon. The scene is set aboard the Pequod in the 19th century, with muted navy and charcoal tones, sharp chiaroscuro lighting, fine linework blended with semi‑realistic gradients, subtle paper grain, capturing his alien isolation within the Christian world. Romantic realism, 1800s maritime setting."

    "segment_text": "And as when spring and summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his own paws.",
    "image_prompt": "Ahab stands alone on the dimly lit quarterdeck, his weathered face a silhouette against a storm‑clouded sky, the wind whipping his beard like a wild bear’s fur. His eyes are hollow, shoulders hunched as if he were burrowed in a tree’s hollow, clutching a carved ivory knife. The deck is slick with sea spray, lanterns cast harsh chiaroscuro shadows; deep navy and charcoal tones dominate, Romantic realism style, 19th‑century nautical drama."

    "image_prompt": "A solitary, weather‑worn Captain Ahab stands in a dimly lit cabin, his gaunt silhouette framed by deep navy shadows and sharp charcoal lines. The cramped space feels cavernous, echoing with the howling wind outside. Ahab’s hollow eyes stare into an unseen abyss, as if his soul is trapped within a caved trunk of flesh, feeding on the sullen gloom that swirls around him—Romantic realism, 19th‑century seafaring tone."
