00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,792
Chapter 132 - The Symphony.

2
00:00:00,832 --> 00:00:02,554
Chapter 132 - The Symphony.

3
00:00:03,435 --> 00:00:05,038
It was a clear steel-blue day.

4
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:22,360
The firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure, only the pensive air was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust and manlike sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells as Samson's chest in his sleep.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,725
hither and thither on high glided the snow-white wings of small unspeckled birds.

6
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,849
These were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air.

7
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:43,661
But to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty leviathans, swordfish, and sharks, and these were the strong, troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.

8
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:50,288
But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and shadows without.

9
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,219
Those two seemed one.

10
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,262
It was only the sex, as it were, that distinguished them.

11
00:00:57,203 --> 00:01:05,312
Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea, even as bride to groom.

12
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:10,237
And at the girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion.

13
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:19,047
Most seen here at the equator denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.

14
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:23,211
Tied up and twisted, gnarled and knotted with wrinkles,

15
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:28,860
haggardly firm and unyielding, his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the ashes of ruin.

16
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:36,633
Untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn, lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's forehead of heaven.

17
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, immortal infancy and innocency of the azure!

18
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:44,686
Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us!

19
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:48,051
Sweet childhood of air and sky!

20
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:51,927
How oblivious were ye of old, Ahab's close-coiled woe!

21
00:01:52,708 --> 00:02:04,579
But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gamble around their old sire, sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:16,131
Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity.

23
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:23,714
But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.

24
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:29,462
That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him.

25
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:45,443
The stepmother world, so long cruel, forbidding, now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that however willful in airing, she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless.

26
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:53,016
From beneath his slouched hat, Ahab dropped a tear into the sea, nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one we drop.

27
00:02:53,917 --> 00:03:04,495
Starbuck saw the old man, saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side, and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the center of the serenity around.

28
00:03:04,964 --> 00:03:10,034
Careful not to touch him or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him and stood there.

29
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:11,417
Ahab turned.

30
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:12,759
Starbuck, sir!

31
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,469
Oh, Starbuck, it is a mild, mild wind and a mild-looking sky.

32
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:21,657
On such a day, very much such a sweetness as this!

33
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:35,933
I struck my first whale, a boy harpooneer of eighteen, Forty, forty, forty years ago, ago, Forty years of continual whaling, Forty years of continual whaling, Forty years of privation and pearl and storm-time.

34
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:43,662
For forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, For forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep.

35
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:48,549
I and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore.

36
00:03:48,589 --> 00:04:00,905
When I think of this life I have led, the desolation of solitude it has been, the masoned, walled town of a captain's exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without.

37
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:07,995
Oh, weariness, heaviness, heaviness, guinea-coast slavery of solitary command.

38
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:38,775
When I think of all this, only half suspected, not so keenly known to me before, and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare, fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil, when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the world's fresh bread to my moldy crusts, away, whole oceans away, from that young girl wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow.

39
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:39,296
Wife?

40
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:42,079
Rather a widow with her husband alive.

41
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:59,481
Ay, I widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck, and then the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with which for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly chased his prey, more a demon than a man.

42
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:04,472
Aye, aye, what a forty years' fool, Fool, old fool, has old Ahab been!

43
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:06,537
Why this strife of the chase?

44
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:11,207
Why weary and palsy the arm at the oar, And the iron and the lance?

45
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:14,635
How the richer or better is Ahab now!

46
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:15,156
Behold!

47
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:16,798
Oh, Starbuck!

48
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:22,107
Is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under me?

49
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:26,634
Here, brush this old hair aside, it blinds me, that I seem to weep.

50
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:29,899
Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes.

51
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,667
But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck?

52
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:42,259
I feel deadly faint, bowed and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise.

53
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:42,719
God!

54
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,420
God!

55
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,021
God!

56
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:44,822
Cod!

57
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:46,323
Crack my heart!

58
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:48,005
Stave my brain!

59
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:49,026
Mockery!

60
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:50,027
Mockery!

61
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:53,010
Bitter biting mockery of grey hairs!

62
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:58,235
Have I lived enough joy to wear ye and seem and feel thus intolerably old?

63
00:05:59,076 --> 00:05:59,476
Close!

64
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:01,959
Stand close to me, Starbuck.

65
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,541
Let me look into a human eye.

66
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:09,006
It is better than to gaze into sea or sky, better than to gaze upon God.

67
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:11,771
By the green land, by the bright hearthstone.

68
00:06:12,492 --> 00:06:14,115
This is the magic glass, man.

69
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:16,960
I see my wife and my child in thine eye.

70
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:20,146
No, no, stay on board, on board.

71
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,654
Lower not when I do, when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick.

72
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:26,797
That hazard shall not be thine.

73
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:31,686
No, no, not with the faraway home I see in that eye.

74
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:41,244
O my captain, my captain, noble soul, grand old heart after all, why should any one give chase to that hated fish?

75
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:46,554
Away with me, let us fly these deadly waters, let us home.

76
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:49,519
Wife and child, too, are Starbucks.

77
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:54,248
Wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth,

78
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:59,596
Even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age.

79
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:00,738
Away!

80
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:02,261
Let us away.

81
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,684
This instant let me alter the course.

82
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:10,634
How cheerily, how hilariously, O my captain, would we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again.

83
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:15,561
I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days even as this in Nantucket.

84
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,504
They have, they have.

85
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:22,412
I have seen them, some summer days in the morning, about this time.

86
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:24,555
Yes, it is his noon nap now.

87
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:35,091
The boy vivaciously wakes, sits up in bed, and his mother tells him of me, of cannibal old me, how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to dance him again.

88
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:45,025
"'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself, she promised that my boy, every morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father's sail.

89
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:47,568
Yes, yes, no more, it is done.

90
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,371
We head for Nantucket.

91
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,657
Come, my captain, study out the course and let us away.

92
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:53,899
Si, si.

93
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:58,166
The boy's face from the window, the boy's hand on the hill.

94
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:06,540
But Ahab's glance was averted, like a blighted fruit tree he shook and cast his last cindered apple to the soil.

95
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:32,157
What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing, is it, what cozening, hidden lord and master and cruel, remorseless emperor commands me, that against all natural lovings and longings I so keep pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time, recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart I durst not so much as dare?

96
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,780
Is Ahab, Ahab?

97
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:37,547
Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm?

98
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:55,900
But if the great sun move not of himself, but is as an errand boy in heaven, nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible power, how then can this one small heart beat, this one small brain think thoughts, unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that living, and not I?

99
00:08:56,555 --> 00:09:02,827
By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and fate is the hand spike.

100
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:14,128
And all the time, lo, that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea, look, see Jan Albacore, who put it into him to chase and fang that flying fish.

101
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:16,572
Where do murderers go, man?

102
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:19,696
Who's to doom when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?

103
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:28,167
But it is a mild, mild wind and a mild-looking sky, and the air smells now, as if it blew from a faraway meadow.

104
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:31,911
They have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes.

105
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,476
Starbuck and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay.

106
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:36,858
Sleeping?

107
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:38,299
Ay, toil we!

108
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,884
How we may, we all sleep at last on the field.

109
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:42,426
Sleep?

110
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:50,342
Aye, and rust amid greenness, as last year's scythes flung down and left in the half-cut swaths.

111
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:51,825
Starbuck!

112
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:56,775
But blanched to a corpse's hue with despair, the mate had stolen away.

113
00:09:56,815 --> 00:10:04,270
Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side, but started at two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there.

114
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:08,479
Fidala was motionlessly leaning over the same rail.
