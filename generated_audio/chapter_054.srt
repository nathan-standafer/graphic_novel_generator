00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:17,348
Chapter 54 - The Town Hoes Story. Ass Told at the Golden Inn, the Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet more travelers than in any other part.

2
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:23,556
It was not very long after speaking the Goni that another homeward-bound whaleman, the Taonho, was encountered.

3
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:26,640
She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians.

4
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,766
In the short game that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick.

5
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:37,615
To some, the general interest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Taonho's story.

6
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:48,004
which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so-called judgments of God, which at times are said to overtake some men.

7
00:00:48,925 --> 00:01:05,560
This latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates, for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the town hoe himself.

8
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:15,412
It was the private property of three Confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy.

9
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:24,325
But the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.

10
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:41,671
Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod's main mast.

11
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:52,827
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record.

12
00:01:53,836 --> 00:02:01,490
The ancient whale cry upon first sighting a whale from the masthead, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.

13
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:13,853
For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one Saint's Eve, smoking upon the thick gilt-tiled piazza of the Golden Inn.

14
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:23,986
Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me, and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.

15
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:39,165
Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the town hoe, sperm-whaler of Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days' sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn.

16
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,072
She was somewhere to the northward of the line.

17
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:49,592
One morning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common.

18
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:53,442
They supposed a swordfish had stabbed her, gentlemen.

19
00:02:53,776 --> 00:03:13,050
but the captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes, and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather.

20
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:26,945
The ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals, but no good luck came, more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased.

21
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:38,245
So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.

22
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:55,833
Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those six and thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free, never mind if the leech should double on her.

23
00:03:56,574 --> 00:04:02,123
In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes,

24
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:08,923
The town hoe had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality.

25
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:19,808
Had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.

26
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:20,562
Lakemen.

27
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:21,625
Buffalo.

28
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:24,532
Pray, what is a lakeman, and where is buffalo?"

29
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:28,702
said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.

30
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:33,575
On the eastern shore of our lake eerie Don, but, I crave your courtesy.

31
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:37,003
Maybe you shall soon hear further of all that.

32
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:55,917
Now, gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old calao to far Manila, this lakeman, in the landlocked heart of our America, had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean.

33
00:04:56,498 --> 00:05:01,827
For in their interflowing aggregate, those grand freshwater seas of ours,

34
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:15,316
Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan, possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the ocean's noblest traits, with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes.

35
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:18,904
They goat-lawn maritime a practice do as do.

36
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:27,016
As the contrasting nations, as they as the Atlantic is, they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies.

37
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:35,509
From the east, dotted all round their banks, here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinac.

38
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:38,073
They have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories.

39
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:56,038
At intervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red-painted faces flashed from out their peltry wigwams, forlanked by ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies, those same woods harboring wild Afric beech.

40
00:05:56,058 --> 00:06:02,627
Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, steel-kilt was wild ocean-born and wild ocean-nurtured,

41
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:05,172
as much of an audacious mariner as any.

42
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:24,987
And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea, though in afterlife he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific, yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seamen, fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn-handled bowie knives.

43
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:45,169
Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits, and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave's right, thus treated, this steel-kilt had long been retained harmless and docile.

44
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:52,084
At all events he had proved so thus far, but Radney was doomed and made mad, and steel-kilt.

45
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:54,928
But, gentlemen, you shall hear.

46
00:06:54,988 --> 00:07:07,849
It was not more than a day or two at the furthest, after pointing her prowl for her island haven, that the town-ho's leak seemed again increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day.

47
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:30,698
You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it, though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.

48
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:35,403
nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen.

49
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:43,471
Is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump handles in full chorus, even for a voyage of considerable length?

50
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:50,698
That is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them.

51
00:07:50,718 --> 00:08:00,668
It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out-of-the-way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.

52
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:12,354
Much this way had it been with the town hoe, so when her leak was found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company, especially by Radney the mate.

53
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:20,412
He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, she did home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze.

54
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:36,124
Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen, gentlemen.

55
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:40,611
Therefore, when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship,

56
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:44,857
Some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part-owner in her.

57
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:59,157
So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small gamesomeness slowly going on among them as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water, clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen.

58
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:05,716
that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper holes.

59
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:26,629
Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours, watery or otherwise, that when a person placed in command over his fellow men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness.

60
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:32,876
And if ye have a chance ye will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower and make a little heap of dust of it.

61
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:37,240
Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events."

62
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:56,160
Steel-kilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy's snorting charger, and a brain and a heart and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steel-kilt Charlemagne had he been born son to Charlemagne's father.

63
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:02,163
But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule, yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.

64
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:05,488
He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.

65
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:14,882
Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest, the lakeman effected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his gay banterings.

66
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:19,028
Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leek this.

67
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:22,333
Hold a canikin, one of ye, and let's have a taste.

68
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:24,149
By the Lord, it's worth bottling.

69
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:28,206
I tell you what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it.

70
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:32,323
He had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.

71
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:35,870
The fact is, boys, that swordfish only began the job.

72
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:46,822
He's come back again with a gang of ship carpenters, sawfish and filefish and whatnot, and the whole posse of them are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom, making improvements, I suppose.

73
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:51,366
If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter him.

74
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,710
They're playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him.

75
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,834
But he's a simple old soul, Rad, and a beauty, too.

76
00:10:58,814 --> 00:11:02,499
Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses.

77
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,425
I wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.

78
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:08,247
Damn your eyes!

79
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:10,130
What's that pump stopping for?"

80
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:13,935
roared Radney, pretending not to have heard the sailor's talk.

81
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:15,838
Thunder away at it!

82
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:19,563
Aye, aye, sir, said Steel-Kilt, merry as a cricket.

83
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:22,307
Lively, boys, lively now!

84
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:33,895
And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire engines, the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's utmost energies.

85
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:47,316
Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the lakeman went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass, his face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow.

86
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:56,477
Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporally exasperated state, I know not, but so it happened.

87
00:11:57,058 --> 00:12:09,034
Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.

88
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:17,713
Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening.

89
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:22,122
It has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time.

90
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:29,217
Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea usages and the instinctive love of neatness and seamen.

91
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:32,724
some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces.

92
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:39,396
But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.

93
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:52,200
Besides, it was the stronger men in the townho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps, and being the most athletic seamen of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs,

94
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:59,702
Consequently, he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades.

95
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:06,763
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.

96
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,352
But there was more than this.

97
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:15,685
The order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in his face.

98
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:25,883
Any man who has gone sailor in a whale ship will understand this, and all this and doubtless much more, the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.

99
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:39,552
but as he sat still for a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder casks heaped up in him and the slow match silently burning along towards them as he instinctively saw all this.

100
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:50,760
that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being, a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved.

101
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:54,986
This nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steel-Kilt.

102
00:13:55,527 --> 00:14:02,198
Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in,

103
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:06,887
He answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.

104
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:18,870
And then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers, who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day.

105
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:34,108
To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner, unconditionally reiterating his command, meanwhile advancing upon the still-seated lakeman with an uplifted cooper's-club hammer which he had snatched from a cast nearby.

106
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:53,481
Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steel kilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate, but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat.

107
00:14:53,562 --> 00:15:00,429
till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.

108
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:11,240
Steel-kilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his intention not to obey.

109
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:22,472
Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man.

110
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:23,950
but it was to no purpose.

111
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:37,933
And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer.

112
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:40,657
Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.

113
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:43,802
Take that hammer away, or look to yourself.

114
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:54,853
But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where the lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth, meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.

115
00:15:55,613 --> 00:16:11,629
Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch, stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poignard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer begrazed his cheek, he Steelkilt would murder him.

116
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:15,735
But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods.

117
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:18,299
Immediately the hammer touched the cheek.

118
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:22,064
The next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head.

119
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:24,788
He fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.

120
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:33,441
Ere the cry could go aft, Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads.

121
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:36,385
They were both canallers.

122
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,221
"'Canallers!'

123
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:38,443
cried Don Pedro.

124
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:42,270
"'We have seen many whale-ships in our harbors, but never heard of your canallers.'

125
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,694
"'Pardon, who and what are they?'

126
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:49,042
"'Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our Grand Erie Canal.

127
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:50,364
You must have heard of it.

128
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:58,879
Nay, Signor, hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy and hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous north.'

129
00:16:58,859 --> 00:16:59,159
I?

130
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,283
Well then, Don, refill my cup.

131
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:09,456
Your chicha is very fine, and ere proceeding further I will tell you what our canallers are, for such information may throw sidelight upon my story.

132
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:25,963
For three sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth of the state of New York, through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages, through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps and affluent, cultivated fields, unrivaled for fertility,

133
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:42,147
by billiard room and bar room, through the holy of holies of great forests, on Roman arches over Indian rivers, through sun and shade, by happy hearts or broken, through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties.

134
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:49,893
and especially by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream.

135
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:51,776
There's your true Ashanti, gentlemen.

136
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:59,647
There howl your pagans, where you ever find them, next door to you, under the long-flung shadow and the snug patronizing lee of churches.

137
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:11,644
For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.

138
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:13,459
Is that a friar passing?"

139
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,926
said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the crowded plaza with humorous concern.

140
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:23,394
Well, for our northern friend, Dame Isabella's inquisition wanes in Lima, laughed Don Sebastian.

141
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:24,856
Proceed, Signor.

142
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:25,777
A moment.

143
00:18:26,258 --> 00:18:28,101
Pardon, cried another of the company.

144
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:39,758
In the name of all us Lemias, I but desire to express to you, Sir Sailor, that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison.

145
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:42,061
Oh, do not bow and look surprised.

146
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:45,667
You know the proverb all along this coast, corrupt as Lima.

147
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:48,210
It but bears out your saying, too.

148
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:53,999
Churches more plentiful than billiard tables, and forever open, and corrupt as Lima.

149
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,462
So too, Venice.

150
00:18:57,123 --> 00:19:00,709
I have been there, the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.

151
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:02,071
Mark, St.

152
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:04,514
Dominic, Perget, your cup.

153
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:08,580
Thanks, here I refill, now, you pour out again.

154
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:17,240
Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the canaler would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked as he.

155
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:29,498
Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck.

156
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,184
But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed.

157
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:40,592
The brigandish guise which the canaler so proudly sports, his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features.

158
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:48,489
A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats, his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities.

159
00:19:49,190 --> 00:20:07,677
Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these canalers, I thank him heartily, would fain be not ungrateful, but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one.

160
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:24,537
In some gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by this, that our wild whale fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains.

161
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:33,968
Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line,

162
00:20:33,948 --> 00:20:44,900
The probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian cornfield and recklessly plowing the waters of the most barbaric seas.

163
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:46,341
I see!

164
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:46,842
I see!

165
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:51,847
impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles.

166
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:53,189
No need to travel!

167
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:54,690
The world's one Lima!

168
00:20:55,371 --> 00:21:01,398
I had thought, now, that at your temperate north the generations were cold and holy as the hills.

169
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,600
But the story,

170
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,785
I left off, gentlemen, where the lakeman shook the backstay.

171
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:14,639
Hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooners who all crowded him to the deck.

172
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:23,614
But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.

173
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:28,333
Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued.

174
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:39,126
While standing out of harm's way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarterdeck.

175
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:48,758
At intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment.

176
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:52,516
But Steel-Kilt and his desperados were too much for them all.

177
00:21:52,996 --> 00:22:04,134
They succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.

178
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:06,237
Come out of that, ye pirates!

179
00:22:06,978 --> 00:22:12,287
roared the captain, now menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.

180
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,931
Come out of that, ye cutthroats!

181
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:29,239
Steel Kilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do, but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his, Steel Kilt's death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands.

182
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:39,130
Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.

183
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:41,268
Will you promise not to touch us if we do?

184
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:42,831
demanded their ringleader.

185
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:44,694
Turn to, turn to.

186
00:22:44,714 --> 00:22:46,257
I make no promise.

187
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:47,358
To your duty.

188
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:51,265
Do you want to sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this?

189
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:52,467
Turn to.

190
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:54,951
And he once more raised a pistol.

191
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:57,755
Sink the ship, cried Steelkilt.

192
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,699
Aye, let her sink.

193
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:04,847
Not a man of us turns to unless you swear not to raise a rope yarn against us.

194
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:05,963
What say ye, men?"

195
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:07,605
turning to his comrades.

196
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,828
A fierce cheer was their response.

197
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:17,037
The lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the captain and jerking out such sentences as these.

198
00:23:18,378 --> 00:23:19,259
It's not our fault.

199
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,040
We didn't want it.

200
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:21,782
I told him to take his hammer away.

201
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:23,004
It was boys' business.

202
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:24,506
He might have known me before this.

203
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:26,668
I told him not to prick the buffalo.

204
00:23:26,728 --> 00:23:30,493
I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw.

205
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:34,598
Ain't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men?

206
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,680
Look to those hand spikes, my hearties.

207
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:40,187
Captain, by God, look to yourself, say the word.

208
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:41,349
Don't be a fool.

209
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:42,211
Forget it all.

210
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:43,393
We are ready to turn to.

211
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:45,658
Treat us decently, and we're your men.

212
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:47,381
But we won't be flogged.

213
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:48,643
Turn to.

214
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:50,146
I make no promises.

215
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:51,429
Turn to, I say.

216
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:55,557
Look ye now, cried the lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him.

217
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:59,163
There are a few of us here, and I am one of them who have shipped for the cruise.

218
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:04,413
DC, now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down.

219
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:05,635
So we don't want to row.

220
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:06,817
It's not our interest.

221
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,039
We want to be peaceable.

222
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,604
We are ready to work, but we won't be flogged.

223
00:24:11,205 --> 00:24:12,347
Turn two.

224
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,328
roared the captain.

225
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:29,670
Steel-killed glanced round him a moment and then said, I tell you what it is now, captain, rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us, but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's turn.

226
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:35,197
Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there till you're sick of it.

227
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:37,120
Down ye go.

228
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:38,216
Shall we?"

229
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:39,918
cried the ringleader to his men.

230
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:50,293
Most of them were against it, but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave.

231
00:24:51,115 --> 00:25:07,258
As the lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks, the captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway.

232
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:13,724
Then opening the slide a little, the captain whispered something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them.

233
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:19,992
Ten in number, leaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained neutral.

234
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:34,950
All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft, especially about the four-castle scuttle and four-hatchway, at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below.

235
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,494
But the hours of darkness passed in peace.

236
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:47,227
The men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.

237
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:55,459
At sunrise the captain went forward, and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoners to work, but with a yell they refused.

238
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:03,891
Water was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it, when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,

239
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:05,990
the captain returned to the quarterdeck.

240
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:16,066
Twice every day for three days this was repeated, but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered.

241
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:20,994
And suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.

242
00:26:21,054 --> 00:26:31,431
The fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at discretion.

243
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:41,755
Emboldened by this, the captain reiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged.

244
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:49,128
On the fifth morning, three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them.

245
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:50,871
Only three were left.

246
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:54,447
Better turn to now," said the captain with a heartless jeer.

247
00:26:54,908 --> 00:26:56,230
Shut us up again, will you?"

248
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,312
cried Steel-Kilt.

249
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:00,476
Oh, certainly, the captain and the key clicked.

250
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:10,210
It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him,

251
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,094
and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair.

252
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:38,695
It was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two cannellers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison, and armed with their keen mincing knives, long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each end, run amuck from the bowsprit to the tafrail, and if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship.

253
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:42,221
For himself he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.

254
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:45,166
That was the last night he should spend in that den.

255
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:48,552
But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two.

256
00:27:48,853 --> 00:27:54,002
They swore they were ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.

257
00:27:54,483 --> 00:28:01,054
And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come.

258
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:17,389
But to this their leader is fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself, particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter, and both of them could not be first, for the latter would but admit one man at a time.

259
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,544
And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.

260
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:42,246
Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of treachery, namely, to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender, and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit.

261
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:52,379
But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villainy, mixed their before-secret treacheries together.

262
00:28:52,939 --> 00:29:11,322
And when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences, and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords, and shrieked out for the captain at midnight, thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all his armed mates and harpeniers rushed for the forecastle,

263
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:25,237
In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still-struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder.

264
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:36,710
But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle, and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzenrigging, like three-quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning.

265
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:38,091
Damn ye!

266
00:29:38,392 --> 00:29:41,595
cried the captain, pacing to and fro before them.

267
00:29:41,575 --> 00:29:43,858
The vultures would not touch ye, ye villains.

268
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:57,796
At sunrise he summoned all hands, and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round, thought upon the whole he would do so.

269
00:29:57,836 --> 00:29:58,938
He ought to.

270
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,600
Justice demanded it.

271
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:09,051
But for the present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.

272
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:28,137
But as for you, ye carrion rogues, turning to the three men in the rigging, for you I mean to mince ye up for the tripods, and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traders, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn.

273
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,920
My wrist is sprained with year!"

274
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:31,863
he cried, at last.

275
00:30:32,403 --> 00:30:35,909
But there is still rope enough left for you, my fine Bantam, that wouldn't give up.

276
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:39,474
Take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himself.

277
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:51,812
For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort of hiss, What I say is this, and mind it well.

278
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,554
If you flog me, I murder you.

279
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,838
Say ye so, then see how ye frighten me."

280
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:59,542
And the captain drew off with the rope to strike.

281
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:01,785
Best not, hissed the lakeman.

282
00:31:02,305 --> 00:31:03,006
But I must.

283
00:31:03,547 --> 00:31:06,010
And the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.

284
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:18,846
Steel-kilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain, who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said,

285
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:19,647
I won't do it.

286
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:20,689
Let him go.

287
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:22,371
Cut him down, die here."

288
00:31:23,553 --> 00:31:29,522
But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man with a bandaged head arrested them.

289
00:31:30,244 --> 00:31:31,385
Radney the chief mate.

290
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:41,661
Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth, but that morning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene.

291
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:53,316
Such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak, but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.

292
00:31:54,218 --> 00:31:56,623
You are a coward, hissed the lakeman.

293
00:31:57,364 --> 00:31:59,228
So I am, but take that.

294
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:04,966
The mate was in the very act of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm.

295
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:12,306
He paused, and then pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steel-Kilt's threat, whatever that might have been.

296
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:21,041
The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.

297
00:32:21,802 --> 00:32:33,500
Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was heard in the forecastle, and the two trembling traders running up besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.

298
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:40,892
Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in the ship's run for salvation.

299
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:43,948
Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest.

300
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:58,003
On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt's instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body.

301
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:03,470
But in order to ensure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing.

302
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:08,181
Namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered.

303
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:17,882
For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the town host still maintained her masked heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment.

304
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:29,135
as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground, and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.

305
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:43,751
But though the lakemen had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel, at least till all was over, concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart.

306
00:33:44,432 --> 00:33:46,975
He was in Radney the chief mate's watch.

307
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:51,844
and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than halfway to meet his doom.

308
00:33:51,864 --> 00:34:00,120
After the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night.

309
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:07,115
Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.

310
00:34:07,636 --> 00:34:18,919
During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarterdeck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat, which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side.

311
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:22,145
In this attitude, it was well known he sometimes dozed.

312
00:34:22,706 --> 00:34:27,795
There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea.

313
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:37,712
Steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed.

314
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:44,063
At his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below.

315
00:34:44,228 --> 00:34:45,229
What are you making there?"

316
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,151
said his shipmate.

317
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:47,393
What do you think?

318
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:48,615
What does it look like?

319
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:52,300
Like a lanyard for your bag, but it's an odd one, seems to me.

320
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:57,047
Yes, rather oddish, said the lakeman, holding it at arm's length before him.

321
00:34:57,468 --> 00:34:58,509
But I think it will answer.

322
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,714
Shipmate, I haven't enough twine, have you any?

323
00:35:01,897 --> 00:35:03,320
but there was none in the forecastle.

324
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:06,707
Then I must get some from old Rad, and he rose to go aft.

325
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:09,814
You'd all mean to go a-begging to him, said a sailor.

326
00:35:10,295 --> 00:35:10,716
Why not?

327
00:35:11,257 --> 00:35:15,607
Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's to help himself in the end, shipmate?

328
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:21,880
And going to the mate he looked at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock.

329
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:23,024
It was given him.

330
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:35,242
Neither twine nor lanyard were seen again, but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman's monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow.

331
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:45,336
Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm, nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman's hand.

332
00:35:45,316 --> 00:35:54,827
That fatal hour was then to come, and in the foreordaining soul of Steel-Kilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.

333
00:35:54,887 --> 00:36:01,055
But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned.

334
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:05,079
Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the Avenger.

335
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,187
For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own.

336
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:13,990
The damning thing he would have done.

337
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:26,608
It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Tenerife man, drawing water in the main chains, all at once shouted out, There she rolls!

338
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:27,690
There she rolls!

339
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:29,654
Jesu, what a whale!

340
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,177
It was Moby Dick!

341
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,460
Moby Dick!

342
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:34,204
cried Don Sebastian, St.

343
00:36:34,264 --> 00:36:35,286
Dominic.

344
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:37,840
Sir sailor, but do whales have christenings?

345
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,301
Whom call you Moby Dick?

346
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:45,127
A very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster, Don, but that would be too long a story.

347
00:36:45,947 --> 00:36:49,210
How, how, cried all the young Spaniards crowding.

348
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:53,033
Nay, Dons, Dons, nay, nay, I cannot rehearse that now.

349
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:55,095
Let me get more into the air, sirs.

350
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:59,479
The chicha, the chicha, the chicha, cried Don Pedro.

351
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,861
Our vigorous friend looks faint.

352
00:37:02,202 --> 00:37:03,923
Fill up his empty glass.

353
00:37:03,903 --> 00:37:06,847
No need, gentlemen, one moment, and I proceed.

354
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:14,576
Now, gentlemen, so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship, forgetful of the compact among the crew.

355
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:26,912
In the excitement of the moment, the Tenerife man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mastheads.

356
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,235
All was now a frenzy.

357
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:30,196
The white whale!

358
00:37:30,536 --> 00:37:31,457
The white whale!"

359
00:37:31,878 --> 00:37:53,400
was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooners, who, undeterred by fearful rumors, were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish, while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea.

360
00:37:53,380 --> 00:38:01,231
Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.

361
00:38:01,992 --> 00:38:12,987
The mutineer was the bozeman of the mate, and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of command.

362
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:22,780
Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mates got the start, and none howled more fiercely with the light than did Steelkilt as he strained at his oar.

363
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,713
After a stiff pull, their harpooner got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow.

364
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:36,972
He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat, and now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whale's topmost back.

365
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:49,667
Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together, till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate.

366
00:38:50,649 --> 00:38:53,475
That instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back,

367
00:38:53,455 --> 00:39:00,163
The boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while Radney was tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale.

368
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:09,214
He struck out through the spray and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.

369
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:18,805
But the whale rushed round and a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and, rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again and went down.

370
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:26,217
Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the lakeman had slackened the line so as to drop a stern from the whirlpool.

371
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:29,487
Calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts.

372
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:34,656
But a sudden, terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line.

373
00:39:35,277 --> 00:39:37,138
He cut it, and the whale was free.

374
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:44,825
But at some distance, Moby Dick rose again with some tatters of Radney's red woolen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him.

375
00:39:45,486 --> 00:39:50,991
All four boats gave chase again, but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared.

376
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:59,018
In good time, the town hoe reached her port, a savage, solitary place where no civilized creature resided.

377
00:39:59,403 --> 00:40:13,484
There, headed by the lakemen, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms, eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double-war canoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor.

378
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:23,419
The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak.

379
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:44,344
But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel.

380
00:40:44,999 --> 00:41:09,724
After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far offshore as possible, loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows, stacked his muskets on the poop, and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti 500 miles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew.

381
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:15,572
On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was described, which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.

382
00:41:16,534 --> 00:41:24,545
He steered away from it, but the savage craft bore down on him, and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him underwater.

383
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:27,409
The captain presented a pistol.

384
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:38,502
With one foot on each prow of the yoked war canoes, the lakeman laughed him to scorn, assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.

385
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:40,968
What do you want of me, cried the captain.

386
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:46,461
Where are you bound, and for what are you bound, demanded Steel-Kilt, no lies.

387
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:48,483
I am bound to Tahiti for more men.

388
00:41:49,364 --> 00:41:49,885
Very good.

389
00:41:50,245 --> 00:41:51,426
Let me board you a moment.

390
00:41:51,727 --> 00:41:52,488
I come in peace."

391
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:59,535
With that, he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat, and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the captain.

392
00:42:00,396 --> 00:42:01,317
Cross your arms, sir.

393
00:42:01,598 --> 00:42:02,439
Throw back your head.

394
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:04,281
Now, repeat after me.

395
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:11,108
As soon as Steel Kilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on Yonder Island and remain there six days.

396
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:14,592
If I do not, may lightning strike me.

397
00:42:14,842 --> 00:42:17,185
A pretty scholar, laughed the lakeman.

398
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:18,027
Adios, senor.

399
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:21,552
And leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.

400
00:42:22,313 --> 00:42:32,869
Watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the roots of the coconut trees, Steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination.

401
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,192
There, luck befriended him.

402
00:42:35,593 --> 00:42:42,503
Two ships were about to sail for France and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed.

403
00:42:42,483 --> 00:42:49,451
They embarked, and so forever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.

404
00:42:50,973 --> 00:43:00,324
Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea.

405
00:43:01,385 --> 00:43:08,473
Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel, and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.

406
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:11,139
Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know.

407
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:17,452
But upon the island of Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead.

408
00:43:17,753 --> 00:43:21,180
Still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him.

409
00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:22,203
Are you through?"

410
00:43:22,243 --> 00:43:24,087
said Don Sebastian quietly.

411
00:43:24,107 --> 00:43:25,509
I am, Don.

412
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:32,522
Then I entreat you, tell me if, to the best of your own convictions, this your story is in substance really true.

413
00:43:32,882 --> 00:43:34,425
It is so passing wonderful.

414
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:37,090
Did you get it from an unquestionable source?

415
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:39,895
Bear with me if I seem to press.

416
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:46,522
Also bear with all of us, Sir Sailor, for we all join in Don Sebastian's suit," cried the company with exceeding interest.

417
00:43:47,143 --> 00:43:50,207
Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelist in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?

418
00:43:50,987 --> 00:43:56,393
Nay, said Don Sebastian, but I know a worthy priest nearby who will quickly procure one for me.

419
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:58,956
I go for it, but are you well advised?

420
00:43:59,477 --> 00:44:00,858
This may grow too serious.

421
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,903
Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?

422
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:13,112
Though there are no autodafes in Lima now, said one of the company to another, I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy.

423
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:15,454
Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight.

424
00:44:15,815 --> 00:44:16,856
I see no need of this.

425
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:25,826
Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian, but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest-sized evangelists you can.

426
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:34,435
This is the priest, he brings you the evangelists, said Don Sebastian gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.

427
00:44:34,415 --> 00:44:35,917
Let me remove my hat.

428
00:44:36,638 --> 00:44:41,907
Now, venerable priest, further into the light and hold the holy book before me that I may touch it.

429
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:48,818
So help me, heaven, and on my honor the story I have told you, gentlemen, is in substance and its great items true.

430
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:50,560
I know it to be true.

431
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:52,043
It happened on this ball.

432
00:44:52,283 --> 00:44:53,104
I trod the ship.

433
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:54,086
I knew the crew.

434
00:44:54,106 --> 00:44:57,992
I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.
