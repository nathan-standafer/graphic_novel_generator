00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:10,124
Chapter 53 THE GAME The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was thisâ€”the wind and sea betoken storms.

2
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:21,078
But even had this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded her, judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions if.

3
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:28,587
So it had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put.

4
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:40,841
For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought.

5
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:56,278
But all this, might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising round.

6
00:00:56,258 --> 00:01:11,955
If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England, if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation.

7
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:18,665
and stopping for a moment to interchange the news, Esch, and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert.

8
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:32,104
Then, how much more natural that upon the unlimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two wailing vessels descrying each other at the end of the day, and especially with this seeming to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one sea-port,

9
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:44,322
and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men, are personally known to each other, and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about.

10
00:01:44,521 --> 00:02:10,984
For the long-absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on board, at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later, than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files, and, in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising ground to which she may be destined.

11
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,007
a thing of the utmost importance to her.

12
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:38,490
And in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other's track on the cruising ground itself, even though they are equally long absent from home, for one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now far-remote vessel, and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets.

13
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:44,340
Besides, they would exchange the wailing news, and have an agreeable chat.

14
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:57,744
For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils.

15
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:02,031
Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference.

16
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:09,761
That is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case with Americans and English.

17
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:25,943
Though, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and, when they do occur, there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them, for your Englishman is rather reserved and your Yankee

18
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:30,710
He does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself.

19
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:45,332
Besides, the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers regarding the long, lean Nantuckter with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort of sea peasant.

20
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:55,727
But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees and one day, collectively,

21
00:03:55,707 --> 00:04:00,334
kill more whales than all the English collectively in ten years.

22
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:12,433
But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart, probably because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.

23
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:21,537
So then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers have most reason to be sociable, and they are so.

24
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:32,802
Whereas some merchant ships, crossing each other's wake in the mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,

25
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:44,358
mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in Broadway, and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each other's rig.

26
00:04:44,378 --> 00:05:01,742
As for men of war, when they chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much write-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all.

27
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:17,740
As touching slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as possible, and as for pirates, when they chance to cross each other's crossbones, the first hail is

28
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,882
How many skulls?

29
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:21,165
The same way that whaler's hail is.

30
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:22,366
How many barrels?"

31
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,310
And that question once answered.

32
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:35,543
Pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don't like to see over much of each other's villainous likenesses.

33
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:42,833
But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable, free and easy whaler,

34
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:48,441
What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather?

35
00:05:48,562 --> 00:06:07,690
She has a gam, a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even, and, if by chance, they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat game some stuff about spouters and blubber-boilers, and such like pretty exclamations.

36
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:31,112
Why it is that all merchant seamen, and also all pirates and men-of-war's men, and slave-ship sailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale-ships, this is a question it would be hard to answer, because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it.

37
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:43,722
It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed only at the gallows, and besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude.

38
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:49,135
Hence I conclude that in boasting himself to be high-lifted above a whaleman,

39
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:53,364
In that assertion, the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.

40
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:54,888
But what is a gamb?

41
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:01,763
You might wear out your index finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word.

42
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:05,871
Dr. Johnson never attains to that erudition.

43
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:08,878
Noah Webster's Ark does not hold it.

44
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:17,533
Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now, for many years, been in constant use among some 15,000 true-born Yankees.

45
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:22,721
Certainly it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the lexicon.

46
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:26,648
With that view, let me learnedly define it.

47
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:27,249
Damn!

48
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:42,426
Now in a social meeting of two or more whale-ships, generally on a cruising ground, when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits by boat's cruise, purses, the captains remaining, for the time on board of one ship

49
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:44,790
and the two chief-mates on the other.

50
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:49,798
There is another little item about gaming which must not be forgotten here.

51
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:54,486
All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail.

52
00:07:55,147 --> 00:07:57,030
So has the whale-fishery.

53
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:03,300
In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave-ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat,

54
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:16,319
He always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's tiller, decorated with gay cords and ribbons.

55
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:22,408
But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all.

56
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:31,701
High times indeed if whaling-captains were wheeled about the water on casters like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs.

57
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:57,604
And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy, and therefore, as in gamming, a complete boat's crew must leave the ship, and hence, as the boat's steerer or harpooner is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit, all standing like a pine-tree.

58
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:14,597
And often you will notice that, being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.

59
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:28,926
Nor is this any very easy matter, for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar, hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after oar reciprocating by wrapping his knees in front.

60
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:43,707
He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs, but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him.

61
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:48,100
Because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth.

62
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,352
Merely make a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.

63
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:58,810
Well, then again it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes, it would never do

64
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:07,285
I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands.

65
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:22,131
Indeed, as token of his entire buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands in his trousers' pockets, but, perhaps, being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.

66
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:40,322
Nevertheless, there have occurred instances, well-authenticated ones, too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall, say, to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's hair, and hold on there like grim death.
