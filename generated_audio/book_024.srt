00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,173
Bookwix IV.

2
00:00:01,914 --> 00:00:06,261
The ghosts of the suitors and haids, Ulysses and his men go to the house of Lurtas.

3
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:10,888
The people of Ithaca come out to attack Ulysses, but Minerva concludes apiece.

4
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:21,945
Then Mercury of Cilene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his hand he held the fair golden wand, with which he seals men's eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as he pleases.

5
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:27,253
With this he roused the ghosts and led them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind him.

6
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:40,701
As bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even so did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury, the healer of sorrow, led them down into the dark abode of death.

7
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:44,348
When they had passed the waters of Oceanus and the rock Leucus,

8
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:53,809
They came to the gates of the sun and the land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of Asphodel, where dwell the souls and shadows of them that can labour no more.

9
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:05,847
Here they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man of all the Danaeans after the son of Peleus himself.

10
00:01:05,827 --> 00:01:11,517
They gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly.

11
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:18,109
Round him were gathered also the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus, and the ghost of Achilles spoke first.

12
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:29,809
Son of Atreus, it said, we used to say that Jove had loved you better from first to last than any other hero, for you were captain over many and brave men when we were all fighting together before Troy.

13
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:34,487
yet the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all too early.

14
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:41,233
Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the heyday of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your ashes,

15
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:47,153
your son would have been heir to your good name, whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.

16
00:01:48,034 --> 00:02:04,673
Happy son of Peleus," answered the ghost of Agamemnon, for having died at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body, there you lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely heedless now of your chivalry.

17
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:10,725
We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should we ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us.

18
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:18,540
Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray, we laid you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments.

19
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:22,388
The Deneans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you.

20
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,897
Your mother, when she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea,

21
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:31,582
and the sound of a great wailing went forth over the waters, so that the Achaeans quaked for fear.

22
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:40,172
They would have fled panic-stricken to their ships, had not wise old Nestor, whose counsel was ever truest, checked them, saying, Hold, Argives!

23
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:42,054
Fly not, sons of the Achaeans!

24
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:46,640
This is his mother coming from the sea with her immortal nymphs to view the body of her son.

25
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:50,404
Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more.

26
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:55,711
The daughters of the old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly and clothed you in immortal raiment.

27
00:02:56,071 --> 00:03:00,998
The nigh muses also came and lifted up their sweet voices in lament, calling and answering one another.

28
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:04,702
There was not an argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chanted.

29
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:08,888
Days and nights, seven and ten, we mourned you, mortals and immortals.

30
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:16,257
But on the eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep with many an ox did we slay and sacrifice around you.

31
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:26,560
You were burnt in raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes, horse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were burning, with the tramp as of a great multitude.

32
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:34,397
But when the flames of heaven had done their work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in ointments and in pure wine.

33
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:39,747
Your mother brought us a golden vase to hold them, gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself.

34
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:51,909
In this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroclus who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those of Antilochus, who had been closer to you than any other of your comrades now that Patroclus was no more.

35
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,896
Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb,

36
00:03:55,876 --> 00:04:04,305
on a point jutting out over the open hellespont that it might be seen from far out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born hereafter.

37
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:10,492
Your mother begged prizes from the gods and offered them to be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans.

38
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:19,842
You must have been present at the funeral of many a hero when the young men gird themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some great chieftain,

39
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:25,129
But you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis offered in your honor, for the gods loved you well.

40
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,938
Thus even in death your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore among all mankind.

41
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,084
But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?

42
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:42,352
For Jove willed my destruction on my return by the hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.

43
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:49,542
Thus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with the ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses,

44
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:54,672
The ghosts of Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to them at once.

45
00:04:55,413 --> 00:05:05,792
The ghost of Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon son of Melanius, who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began to talk to him.

46
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:11,161
What has happened to all you fine young men, all of an age too, that you are come down here under the ground?

47
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:14,346
One could pick no finer body of men from any city.

48
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:18,253
Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you when you were at sea?

49
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:26,346
Or did your enemies make an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle lifting or sheep stealing or while fighting in defense of their wives and city?

50
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,809
Answer my question, for I have been your guest.

51
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,279
Do you not remember how I came to your house with Menelaus to persuade Ulysses to join us with his ships against Troy?

52
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,786
It was a whole month ere we could resume our voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come with us.

53
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:52,823
And the ghost of Amphimodon answered, Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of men, I remember everything that you have said and will tell you fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.

54
00:05:52,887 --> 00:06:02,487
Ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did not say point-blank that she would not marry nor yet bring matters to an end, for she meant to compass our destruction.

55
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:04,992
This, then, was the trick she played us.

56
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:11,605
She set up a great tambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework.

57
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:14,711
"'Sweethearts,' said she, "'Ulysses is indeed dead.

58
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:17,617
Still, do not press me to marry again immediately.

59
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:26,474
Wait, for I would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes against the time when death shall take him.

60
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:31,804
He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.'

61
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:40,434
This is what she said, and we assented, whereupon we could see her working upon her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight.

62
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:56,053
She fooled us in this way for three years without our finding it out, but as time wore on, and she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work,

63
00:06:56,033 --> 00:07:05,650
So she had to finish it whether she would or no, and when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had it washed when eighty-six, its splendour was as that of the sun or moon.

64
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:11,460
Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his swineherd lives.

65
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:19,479
Thither presently came also his son, returning from a voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had hatched their plot for our destruction.

66
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:29,702
Telemachus came first, and then after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar.

67
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:36,233
He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him.

68
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:49,395
He endured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house, but when the will of Aegis bearing Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus took the armor and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors behind them.

69
00:07:49,375 --> 00:08:01,332
Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors, and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string the bow, nor nearly do so.

70
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:11,046
When it was about to reach the hands of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him, no matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having it.

71
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:14,629
When he had got it in his hands, he strung it with ease and sent his arrow through the iron.

72
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,074
Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him.

73
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:27,101
First he killed Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts, and they fell thick on one another.

74
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:39,632
It was plain that someone of the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us with might and maim throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in and the ground seethed with our blood.

75
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:56,760
This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are lying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends at home do not yet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the officers due to the departed.

76
00:08:57,213 --> 00:09:09,667
Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes, replied the ghost of Agamemnon, you are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope the daughter of Icarius.

77
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:19,238
The fame therefore of her virtue shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be welcomed to all mankind in honor of the constancy of Penelope.

78
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:30,134
How far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus who killed her lawful husband, her song shall be hateful among men, for she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.

79
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:35,262
Thus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the bowels of the earth.

80
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:44,415
Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the town, and soon reached the fair and well-tealed farm of Laertes, which he had reclaimed with infinite labor.

81
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:55,705
Here was his house, with a lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked for him slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicil woman who looked after him in this his country farm.

82
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:02,661
When Ulysses got there, he said to his son and to the other two, go to the house and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.

83
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:08,791
Meanwhile, I want to see whether my father will know me or fail to recognize me after so long an absence.

84
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:17,406
He then took off his armor and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius, who went straight on to the house while he turned off into the vineyard to make trial of his father.

85
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:32,027
As he went down into the great orchard, he did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons, nor of the other bondsmen, for they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the place where the old man had told them, he therefore found his father alone, hoeing a vine.

86
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,373
He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very shabby.

87
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:42,182
His legs were bound round with thongs of oxide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather.

88
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:46,609
He had a goatskin cap on his head and was looking very woe-begone.

89
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:54,160
When Ulysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep.

90
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:02,130
He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having come home, or whether he should first question him and see what he would say.

91
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:10,121
In the end, he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so in this mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging about a plant.

92
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:16,570
"'I see, sir,' said Ulysses, "'that you are an excellent gardener, what pains you take with it, to be sure.

93
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:23,599
There is not a single plant, not a fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower-bed, but bears the trace of your attention.

94
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,747
I trust, however, that you will not be offended if I say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself.

95
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:33,152
You are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad.

96
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:37,818
It cannot be because you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you.

97
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,806
Indeed, your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble birth.

98
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:50,511
I should have said that you were one of those who should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do.

99
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:55,696
But tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose garden are you working?

100
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:57,758
Tell me also about another matter.

101
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,521
Is this place that I have come to really Ithaca?

102
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:12,173
I met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow and had not the patience to hear my story out when I was asking him about an old friend of mine, whether he was still living or was already dead and in the house of Hades.

103
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:20,020
Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my house once when I was in my own country, and never yet did any stranger come to me whom I liked better.

104
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:25,305
He said that his family came from Ithaca, and that his father was Laertes, son of Arcesius.

105
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:32,752
I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary presents.

106
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:38,818
I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it.

107
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:48,898
I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces of tapestry, I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts.

108
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,592
To all this I added four good-looking women skilled in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice.

109
00:12:55,572 --> 00:13:03,142
His father shed tears and answered, Sir, you have indeed come to the country that you have named, but it has fallen into the hands of wicked people.

110
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:06,246
All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose.

111
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:17,682
If you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would have entertained you hospitably and would have requited your presents amply when you left him, as would have been only right considering what you had already given him.

112
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:24,644
But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is it since you entertained this guest, my unhappy son, as ever was?

113
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:34,388
Alas, he has perished far from his own country, the fishes of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some continent.

114
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:50,719
Neither his mother, nor I his father, who were his parents, could throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his deathbed, and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed.

115
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,645
But now tell me truly, for I want to know.

116
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:57,051
Who and whence are you tell me of your town and parents?

117
00:13:57,402 --> 00:14:00,886
Where is the ship lying that has brought you and your men to Ithaca?

118
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:07,373
Or were you a passenger on some other man's ship, and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left you?"

119
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:10,176
"'I will tell you everything,' answered Ulysses, quite truly.

120
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,980
"'I come from Alibas, where I have a fine house.

121
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,604
I am son of King Aphidas, who is the son of Polypemon.

122
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:18,786
My own name is Iperitus.

123
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:25,013
Heaven drove me off my course as I was leaving Cycania, and I have been carried here against my will.

124
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:33,063
As for my ship, it is lying over yonder, off the open country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left my country.

125
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,691
Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left me.

126
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:42,343
The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced to see them as we parted,

127
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:46,187
for we had every hope that we should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents.

128
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:50,130
A dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened.

129
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:56,656
He filled both hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his gray head, groaning heavily as he did so.

130
00:14:57,137 --> 00:15:01,501
The heart of Ulysses was touched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father.

131
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:08,467
Then he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying, I am he, father, about whom you are asking.

132
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,790
I have returned after having been away for twenty years.

133
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,055
But cease your sighing and lamentation.

134
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:20,892
We have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes.

135
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:29,813
If you really are my son Ulysses, replied Laertes, and have come back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity as shall convince me.

136
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:36,284
"'First observe this scar,' answered Ulysses, which I got from a boar's tusk when I was hunting on Mantine on Mantida Beauty.

137
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:45,220
Parnassus, you and my mother had sent me to Autolychus, my mother's father, to receive the presents which, when he was over here, he had promised to give me.

138
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:52,267
Furthermore, I will point out to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all about them as I followed you round the garden.

139
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:56,291
We went over them all, and you told me their names and what they all were.

140
00:15:56,691 --> 00:16:00,815
You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees.

141
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,798
You also said you would give me fifty rows of vines.

142
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,785
There was corn planted between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavy upon them.

143
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:15,871
Laertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which his son had given him.

144
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:21,459
He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon.

145
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:33,634
But as soon as he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, O father Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the suitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly.

146
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:43,423
Nevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the cities of the Cephalenians."

147
00:16:43,443 --> 00:16:50,155
Ulysses answered, "'Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that, but let us go into the house hard by your garden.'"

148
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:56,150
I have already told Telemachus, Phileucius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready as soon as possible."

149
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:59,419
Thus conversing the two made their way towards the house.

150
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,815
When they got there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting up meat and mixing wine with water.

151
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:10,523
Then the old cycle woman took Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil.

152
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:17,715
She put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and gave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter than before.

153
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:28,393
When he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like an immortal, and said to him, My dear father, some one of the gods has been making you much taller and better looking.

154
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:39,463
Laertes answered, Would by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephalenians, and took Nerechem, that strong fortress on the foreland.

155
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:47,675
If I were still what I then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armor on, I should have been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors.

156
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:51,699
I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced to see it."

157
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,381
Thus did they converse.

158
00:17:53,842 --> 00:18:00,449
But the others, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, left off working and took each his proper place on the benches and seats.

159
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:01,810
Then they began eating.

160
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:06,075
By and by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their mother,

161
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:10,727
The Sicil woman, who looked after Laertes now that he was growing old, had been to fetch them.

162
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:15,772
When they saw Ulysses and were certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment.

163
00:18:16,193 --> 00:18:22,099
But Ulysses scolded them good-naturedly and said, Sit down to your dinner, old man, and never mind about your surprise.

164
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,583
We have been wanting to begin for some time and have been waiting for you.

165
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:29,267
Then Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses.

166
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:35,674
Sir, said he, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, we have long been wishing you home.

167
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:39,021
and now heaven has restored you to us after we had given up hoping.

168
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:48,201
All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you.187 But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or shall we send someone to tell her?

169
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:53,612
Old man, answered Ulysses, she knows already, so you need not trouble about that.

170
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:59,823
On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius gathered round Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after the other.

171
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,129
Then they took their seats in due order near Dolius their father.

172
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:10,723
While they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, rumour went round the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the suitors.

173
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:17,575
As soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered from every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses.

174
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:27,773
They took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the fisherman to take each of them to his own place.

175
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:33,965
They then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when they were got together Eupathes rose to speak.

176
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:41,959
He was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son Antinous, who had been the first man killed by Ulysses, so he said, weeping bitterly.

177
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,583
My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great wrong.

178
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:49,330
He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he has lost both ships and men.

179
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:54,138
Now, moreover, on his return he has been killing all the foremost men among the Cephalenians.

180
00:19:54,618 --> 00:20:03,372
Let us be up and doing before he can get away to Pylos, or to Elis where the Aepians rule, or we shall be ashamed of ourselves forever afterwards.

181
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:09,381
It will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers.

182
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:14,087
For my own part, I should have no more pleasure in life, but had rather die at once.

183
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:19,475
Let us be up then and after them before they can cross over to the mainland."

184
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:21,718
He wept as he spoke, and everyone pitied him.

185
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:27,085
But Medon and the bard Phemius had now woke up and came to them from the house of Ulysses.

186
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:34,795
Everyone was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle of the assembly and Medon said, Hear me, men of Ithaca.

187
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:37,552
Ulysses did not do these things against the will of heaven.

188
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:42,424
I myself saw an immortal god take the form of mentor and stand beside him.

189
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:48,379
This god appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously about the court.

190
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:51,469
and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on one another.

191
00:20:52,030 --> 00:21:00,443
On this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherse's son of master rose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew both past and future.

192
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:07,954
So he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying, Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as they have.

193
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:19,908
You would not listen to me, nor yet to mentor, when we bade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the wantonness of their hearts, wasting the substance and dishonoring the wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return.

194
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:24,012
Now, however, let it be as I say, and do as I tell you.

195
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:30,820
Do not go out against Ulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your own heads.

196
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,607
This was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout and at once left the assembly.

197
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:41,336
But the rest stayed where they were, for the speech of Halithursus displeased them, and they sided with Eupathes.

198
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:49,568
They therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed themselves they met together in front of the city, and Eupathes led them on in their folly.

199
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:56,438
He thought he was going to avenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was never to return, but was himself to perish in his attempt.

200
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:04,229
Then Minerva said to Jove, Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, answer me this question, what do you propose to do?

201
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,095
Will you set them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?

202
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:11,780
And Jove answered, My child, why should you ask me?

203
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:17,108
Was it not by your own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the suitors?

204
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,632
Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be most reasonable arrangement.

205
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:32,963
Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue to rule, while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of their sons and brothers.

206
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:38,388
Let them then all become friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign."

207
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:45,795
This was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down she darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.

208
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:52,761
Now, when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by saying, Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close up to us.

209
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:55,424
So one of Dolius's sons went as he was bid.

210
00:22:55,824 --> 00:23:00,668
Standing on the threshold, he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses, Here they are.

211
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:02,670
Let us put on our armor at once.

212
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:09,236
They put on their armor as fast as they could, that is to say, Ulysses, his three men, and the six sons of Dolius.

213
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:15,782
Laertes also and Dolius did the same, warriors by necessity, in spite of their gray hair.

214
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:21,591
When they had all put on their armor, they opened the gate and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way.

215
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:27,220
Then Jove's daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the form and voice of mentor.

216
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:43,086
Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said to his son Telemachus, Telemachus, now that you are about to fight in an engagement, which will show every man's mettle, be sure not to disgrace your ancestors who were eminent for their strength and courage all the world over.

217
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:50,342
You say truly, my dear father, answered Telemachus, and you shall see, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.

218
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:53,235
Laertes was delighted when he heard this.

219
00:23:53,655 --> 00:23:54,156
Good heavens!

220
00:23:54,496 --> 00:23:55,117
he exclaimed.

221
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:56,840
What a day I am enjoying!

222
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,382
I do indeed rejoice at it.

223
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:02,347
My son and grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour.

224
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:14,002
On this Minerva came close up to him and said, Son of Arsetius, best friend I have in the world, pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and to Jove her father, then poise your spear and hurl it.

225
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:20,751
As she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had prayed to her he poised his spear and hurled it.

226
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:28,878
He hit Eupethes' helmet, and the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed at naught, and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.

227
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:35,064
Meantime, Ulysses and his son fell upon the front line of the foe, and smote them with their swords and spears.

228
00:24:35,464 --> 00:24:39,588
Indeed, they would have killed every one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again.

229
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:43,331
Only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made everyone pause.

230
00:24:43,852 --> 00:24:50,738
Men of Ithaca, she cried, cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter at once without further bloodshed.

231
00:24:50,718 --> 00:24:53,063
On this pale fear seized everyone.

232
00:24:53,544 --> 00:25:01,421
They were so frightened that their arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of the goddess' voice, and they fled back to the city for their lives.

233
00:25:02,423 --> 00:25:07,714
But Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring eagle.

234
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:19,982
Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to Ulysses, Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will be angry with you.

235
00:25:20,724 --> 00:25:24,252
Thus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly.

236
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:30,564
Then Minerva assumed the form and voice of Mentor and presently made a covenant of peace between the two contending parties.

237
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:41,143
Footnotes, one-toon black races are evidently known to the writer as stretching all across Africa, one half looking west onto the Atlantic and the other east onto the Indian Ocean.

238
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:49,902
The original use of the footstool was probably less to rest the feet than to keep them, especially when bare from a floor which was often wet and dirty.

239
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:50,663
3.

240
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:57,854
The thirtenmieter, or seat, is occasionally called high as being higher than the thirtenmieter, or low footstool.

241
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:02,881
It was probably no higher than an ordinary chair is now, and seems to have had no back.

242
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:09,932
Thirtenfortenmieter and mieter was on the west coast of the Toa of Italy, in what is now the Gulf of Stalyephemia.

243
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:18,389
It was famous in remote times for its copper mines, which, however, were worked out when Straubel wrote, Five photo I E with a current in it.

244
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,013
See illustrations and map near the end of BKS.

245
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:24,436
V and VI, respectively.

00:26:25,136 --> 00:26:27,259

Corner C, meter, four I, GE.

Eight I I. Eight I I. Eight I one, where the same mistake is made, and ZEE.

250
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:45,882
351, where the mountain is called Neritum, the same place being intended both here and in Book Xiyi.

251
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:47,465
Xiyi.

252
00:26:48,146 --> 00:26:52,253
It is never plausibly explained why Penelope cannot do this, and from BK.

253
00:26:53,014 --> 00:26:53,415
Ai Ai.

254
00:26:54,216 --> 00:27:00,186
It is clear that she kept on deliberately encouraging the suitors, though we are asked to believe that she was only fooling them.

255
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:02,419
28, 282.

256
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,343
See note on odd.

257
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:07,566
I, Thucyc 5, 282.

258
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:13,634
9 to middle Argos means the Peloponnese, which, however, is never so called in the Iliad.

259
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:20,603
I presume middle means middle between the two Greek-speaking countries of Asia Minor and Sicily, with South Italy.

260
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:30,696
For that, parts of Sicily, and also large parts, though not the whole of South Italy, were inhabited by Greek-speaking races centuries before the Dorian colonizations can hardly be doubted.

261
00:27:31,638 --> 00:27:35,386
The Scythians, and also the Scythians, both of them probably spoke Greek.

262
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:36,990

That is a man's matter.

275
00:27:51,280 --> 00:28:04,074
It argues a certain hardness, or at any rate dislike, of the Iliad on the part of the writer of the Odyssey that she should have adopted Hector's farewell to Andromache here, as elsewhere in the poem, for a scene of such inferior pathos.

278
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:16,542
The whole open court with the covered cloister running round it was called Tignor, Tignor, or Ainor.

279
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:23,953
But the covered part was distinguished by being called Shady or Shadowgiving.

280
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,123
It was in this part that the tables for the suitors were laid.

281
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:38,319
The fountain court at Hampton Court may serve as an illustration, save as regards the use of arches instead of wooden supports and rafters, and the arrangement is still common in Sicily.

282
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:44,729
The usual translation, shadowy or dusky halls, gives a false idea of the scene.

284

294
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:23,764
The scrupulous regard of Laertes for his wife's feelings is of a piece with the extreme jealousy for the honour of woman, which is manifest throughout the Odyssey.

00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:45,140
There can be no doubt that the Odyssean line was suggested by the Iliadic, but nothing can explain why Idaeus jumping from his chariot should suggest to the writer of the Odyssey the sun jumping from the sea.

333
00:32:46,062 --> 00:32:54,257
The probability is that she never gave the matter a thought, but took the line in question as an effect of saturation with the Iliad and of unconscious cerebration.

334
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:57,246
The Odyssey contains many such examples.

338
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:10,575
The greca, or bone meat, was cooking while the Greek or inward parts were being eaten.

339
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:18,341
I imagine that the thigh bones made a kind of gridiron, while at the same time the marrow inside them got cooked to twenty-six, i.e.

340
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:21,706
skewers, either single, double, or even five pronged.

341
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:29,779
The meat would be pierced with the skewer, and laid over the ashes to grill the two ends of the skewer being supported in whatever way convenient.

342
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,888
Meat so cooking may be seen in any eating-house in Smyrna, or any eastern town.

00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:46,004
When I rode across the Troad from the Dardanelles to Hisarlik and Mount Ida, I noticed that my dragomen and his men did all our outdoor cooking exactly in the Odissian and Iliadic fashion.

W. Problius, the writer ever jealous for the honor of women, extenuates Clytemnestra's guilt as far as possible, and explains it as due to her having been left unprotected and fallen into the hands of a wicked man.

Surely the Greek of the Odyssean passage was due to the Greek of the Iliad.

368
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:52,830
No other reason suggests itself for the making Menelaus return on the very day of the feast given by Orestes.

369
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:58,339
The fact that in the Iliad Menelaus came to a banquet without waiting for an invitation

370
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:09,295
determines the writer of the Odyssey to make him come to a banquet, also uninvited, but as circumstances did not permit of his having been invited, his coming uninvited is shown to have been due to chance.

371
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:17,026
I do not think the author has thought all this out, but attribute the strangeness of the coincidence to unconscious cerebration and saturation.

378
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:25,620
The Odyssean Greek were the sheds that ran round the yard as the arches do now.

379
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:32,190
The Greek was the one through which the main entrance passed and which was hence noisy or reverberating.

380
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,475
It had an upper story in which visitors were often lodged.

381
00:36:36,717 --> 00:36:38,880
This journey is an impossible one.

382
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,742
This journey is an impossible one.

383
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:48,612
Telemachus and Pisistratus would have been obliged to drive over the Tigitus range, over which there has never yet been a road for wheeled vehicles.

384
00:36:49,293 --> 00:37:00,987
It is plain, therefore, that the audience for whom the Odyssey was written was one that would be unlikely to know anything about the topography of the Peloponnese, so that the writer might take what liberties she chose.

385
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:14,210
The lines which I have enclosed in brackets are evidently an afterthought, added probably by the writer herself, for they evince the same instinctively greater interest in anything that may concern a woman, which is so noticeable throughout the poem.

386
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:20,781
There is no further sign of any special festivities nor of any other guests than Telemachus and Pisistratus,

387
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:31,018
until lines 621 to 624, ordinarily enclosed in brackets, are abruptly introduced, probably with a view of trying to carry off the introduction of the lines now in question.

388
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,972
The addition was, I imagine, suggested by a desire to excuse and explain the non-appearance of Hermione in BKW and 60S,

389
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:44,739
as also of both Hermione and Megapenthes in the rest of BKWence in the rest of BKW.

390
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,044
Megapenthes in BKXV seems to be still a bachelor.

391
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:54,811
The presumption, therefore, is that BKXV was written before the story of his marriage here given.

392
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:58,415
I take it he is only married here because his sister is being married.

393
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:03,281
She having been properly attended to, Megapenthes might as well be married at the same time.

394
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,124
Hermione could not now be less than 30.

395
00:38:06,104 --> 00:38:11,115
I have dealt with this passage somewhat more fully in my Authoress of the Odyssey, p.

400
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:32,000
The catalogue in the Iliad, which the writer is here presumably following, makes the same mistake, il.

00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:57,507
Amber is never mentioned in the Iliad.

408
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:06,081
Sicily, where I suppose the Odyssey to have been written, has always been, and still is, one of the principal amber-producing countries.

409
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,029
It was probably the only one known in the Odyssean age.

410

See The Authorus of the Odyssey, Longman's 1898 p186, the 41.

411
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:26,541
This no doubt refers to the story told in the last poem of the Cypria about Paris and Helen robbing Menelaus of the greater part of his treasures when they sailed together for Troy.

412
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:34,511
It is inconceivable that Helen should enter thus, in the middle of supper, intending to work with her distaff, if great festivities were going on.

413
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:39,898
Telemachus and Pisistratus are evidently dining en famille, night 43.

00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:54,712
In the Italian insurrection of 1848, eight young men who were being hotly pursued by the Austrian police hid themselves inside Donatello's colossal wooden horse in the Salone at Padua and remained there for a week, being fed by their confederates.

415
00:39:55,413 --> 00:39:59,098
In 1898, the last survivor was carried round Padua in triumph.

416
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:01,722
The Greek is Greek e. Greek.

417
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:09,953
Is it unfair to argue that the writer is a person of somewhat delicate sensibility, to whom a strong smell of fish is distasteful?

418
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:10,334
No.

428
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:18,748
The Greek is Greek.

429
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:28,083
I believe this to be a hit at the writer's own countrymen who were of Phokian descent, and the next following line to be a rejoinder to complaints made against her in B. K. Phi.

430
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:29,325
By Phi Phi.

431
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:34,953
273-288, to the effect that she gave herself heirs and would marry none of her own people.

432
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:42,925
For that, the writer of the Odyssey was the person who has been introduced into the poem under the name of Nausicaa, I cannot bring myself to question.

433
00:40:43,886 --> 00:40:48,653
I may remind English readers that Greek GGEE Phoka means seal.

434
00:40:49,394 --> 00:40:51,938
Seals almost always appear on Phokian coins.

435
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,722
GG

436
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,465
Sheerly here again, we are in the hands of a writer of delicate sensibility.

437
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:02,669
It is not as though the seals were stale, they had only just been killed.

438
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:07,934
The writer, however, is obviously laughing at her own countrymen and insulting them as openly as she dares.

439
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:09,836
The 47.

440
00:41:10,476 --> 00:41:15,781
We were told above, lines 3056, 3057, that it was only one day's sale.

441
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:17,823
The 48 manny sale.

442
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:22,107
I give the usual translation, but I do not believe the Greek will warrant it.

443
00:41:22,707 --> 00:41:24,709
The Greek reads Greek bannis.

444
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:34,865
This is usually held to mean that Ithaca is an island fit for breeding goats, and on that account more delectable to the speaker than it would have been if it were fit for breeding horses.

445
00:41:35,607 --> 00:41:37,990
I find little authority for such a translation.

446
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:52,013
The most equitable translation of the text as it stands is, Ithaca is an island fit for breeding goats, and delectable rather than fit for breeding horses, for not one of the islands is good driving ground, nor well meadowed.

447
00:41:51,993 --> 00:41:56,979
Surely the writer does not mean that a pleasant or delectable island would not be fit for breeding horses.

448
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:10,897
The most equitable translation, therefore, of the present text being thus halt and impotent, we may suspect corruption, and I hazard the following emendation, though I have not adopted it in my translation, as fearing that it would be deemed too fanciful.

449
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:12,859
I would read, GREEKER.

450
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,464
As far as scanning goes, the GREEKER is not necessary.

451
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:20,008
GREEKER of 72, footnote GREEKIVE.

452
00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:34,329
233, to go no further afield than earlier lines of the same book, gives sufficient authority for Grieco, but the Grieco would not be redundant, it would emphasize the surprise of the contrast, and I should prefer to have it, though it is not very important either way.

453
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,193
This reading, of course, should be translated.

454
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:48,510
Ithaca is an island fit for breeding goats, and by your leave itself a horseman rather than fit for breeding horses, for not one of the islands is good and well-meadowed ground.

455
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:51,341
This would be sure to baffle the Alexandrian editors.

456
00:42:52,143 --> 00:42:55,195
How, they would ask themselves, could an island be a horseman?

457
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:57,724
And they would cast about for an emendation.

458
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:00,070
a visit to the top of Mantinechin.

459
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:08,522
Eryx might perhaps make the meaning intelligible and suggest my proposed restoration of the text to the reader as readily as it did to myself.

460
00:43:09,243 --> 00:43:22,902
I have elsewhere stated my conviction that the writer of the Odyssey was familiar with the old Seacon city at the top of Mantine, Eryx, and that the Aegidean islands which are so striking when seen thence did duty with her for the Ionian islands.

461
00:43:22,882 --> 00:43:27,209
Maretimo, the highest and most westerly of the group, standing for Ithaca.

462
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:32,297
When seen from the top of Might Eryx, Maretimo shows as it should do according to Ode.

463
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:33,639
Ix.

464
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:42,713
25, 26, on the horizon, all highest up in the sea towards the west, while the other islands lie some way off it to the east.

465
00:43:43,368 --> 00:43:50,302
As we descend to Trapani, Maretimo appears to sink on to the top of the island of Lovanzo, behind which it disappears.

466
00:43:50,863 --> 00:44:02,828
My friend, the late Signor Ibiagini, pointed to it once as it was just standing on the top of Lovanzo, and said to me, Come cavalca bene, how well it rides, and this immediately suggested my emendation to me.

467
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:15,383
Later on, I found in the hymn to the Pythian Apollo, which abounds with tags taken from the Odyssey, a line ending Greek which strengthened my suspicion that this was the original ending of the second of the two lines above under consideration.

468
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,132
See note on line 3 of this book.

469
00:44:21,873 --> 00:44:28,059
The reader will observe that the writer has been unable to keep the women out of an interpolation consisting only of four lines.

470
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,084
50 cell 5 n sheria means a piece of land jutting out into the sea.

471
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:43,615
In my authorus of the Odyssey, I thought jutland would be a suitable translation, but it has been pointed out to me that jutland only means the land of the jutes.

472
00:44:43,595 --> 00:44:47,418
Irrigation, as here described, is common in gardens near Tripani.

473
00:44:47,959 --> 00:44:53,224
The water that supplies the duts is drawn from wells by a mule, who turns a wheel with buckets on it.

T.O.T.

475
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,688
There is not a word here about the cattle of the sun god.

D.O.T.O.T.

477
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,834
The writer evidently thought the green, growing wood might also be well seasoned.

D.O.T.

479
00:45:05,975 --> 00:45:06,556
54.

480
00:45:07,316 --> 00:45:10,639
The reader will note that the river was flowing with saltwater, i.e.

481
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:11,520
that it was tidal.

482
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:12,681
D.O.T.

483
00:45:12,701 --> 00:45:13,602

484
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:22,754
Diogegean island was not so far off, but that Nauegegean island was not so far off, but that Nauecheatea might be assumed to know where it was.

485
00:45:22,774 --> 00:45:23,655

486
00:45:24,336 --> 00:45:24,656

57.

490
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:34,689
I suspect a family joke, or sly allusion to something of which we know nothing, in this story of Eurymedusa's having been brought from Epirus.

491
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:38,714
The Greek word Epirus means inexperienced, ignorant.

492
00:45:39,355 --> 00:45:43,420
Is it possible that Eurymedusa was notoriously incompetent?

493
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,342
58-Tus.

494
00:45:44,863 --> 00:45:47,389
Polyphemus was also son to Neptune, see Ode.

497
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:58,135
He was therefore half-brother to Nausethaus, half-uncle to King Alcinus, and half-great-uncle to Nausicaa.

498
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:58,533
59.

499
00:45:58,694 --> 00:46:02,618
It would seem as though the writer thought that Marathon was close to Athens.

500
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:03,759
60.

501
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:13,009
Here, the writer, knowing that she is drawing with embellishments from things actually existing, becomes impatient of past tenses and slides into the present.

502
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:18,175
This is hidden malice, implying that the Phaeacian magnates were no better than they should be.

503
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:26,164
The final drink offering should have been made to Jove or Neptune, not to the god of thievishness and rascality of all kinds.

504
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:38,033
In line 1044, we do indeed find Eceneas proposing that a drink offering should be made to Jove, but Mercury is evidently, according to our authorus, the god who was most likely to be of use to them.

505
00:46:38,774 --> 00:46:39,095
62.

506
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:48,270
The fact of Alcinous knowing anything about the Cyclopes suggests that in the writer's mind, Sheria and the country of the Cyclopes were not very far from one another.

507
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:55,117
I take the Cyclopes and the giants to be one and the same people, non-63, non-my property, etc.

508
00:46:55,718 --> 00:47:03,998
The authoress is here adopting an Iliadic line, x6, 333, and this must account for the absence of all reference to Penelope.

509
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:14,870
If she had happened to remember ill, V213, she would doubtless have appropriated it by preference, for that line reads, my country, my wife, and all the greatness of my house.

510
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:21,097
NE64, the at first inexplicable sleep of Ulysses BK, Shiite.

513
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,863
445 being obviously prepared,

514
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:29,768
The writer evidently attached the utmost importance to it.

515
00:47:30,249 --> 00:47:42,971
Those who know that the harbour which did duty with the writer of the Odyssey, for the one in which Ulysses landed in Ithaca, was only about two miles from the place in which Ulysses is now talking with Alcinous, will understand why the sleep was so necessary.

516
00:47:42,991 --> 00:47:44,734

517
00:47:44,883 --> 00:47:57,298
There were two classes, the lower who were found in provisions which they had to cook for themselves in the yards and outer precincts, where they would also eat, and the upper who would eat in the cloisters of the inner court and have their cooking done for them.

00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:18,683
The writer apparently deems that the words, as compared with what oxen can plough in the same time, go without saying.

526
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:23,308
Not so, the writer of the Iliad, from which the Odyssean passage is probably taken.

536
00:48:43,745 --> 00:48:51,193
Here, as so often elsewhere in the Odyssey, the appropriation of an Iliadic line, which is not quite appropriate, puzzles the reader.

00:48:52,154 --> 00:48:55,338
The they is not the chains, nor yet Mars and Venus.

538
00:48:55,999 --> 00:49:06,190
It is an overflow from the Iliadic passage, in which Neptune hobbles his horses in bonds, which none could either unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place.

539
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:13,345
If the line would have scanned without the addition of the words so that they might stay there in that place, they would have been omitted in the Odyssey.

540
00:49:14,843 --> 00:49:20,392
The reader will note that Alcinous never goes beyond saying that he is going to give the goblet, he never gives it.

541
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:27,684
Elsewhere in both Iliad and Odyssey, the offer of a present is immediately followed by the statement that it was given and received gladly.

542
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:39,023
Alcinous actually does give a chest and a cloak and shirt, probably also some of the corn and wine for the long two-mile voyage was provided by him, but it is quite plain that he gave no talent and no cup.

00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:34,715
I take all this passage about the Cyclopes having no ships to be sarcastic, meaning, you people of Drapanum have no excuse for not colonizing the island of Favoniana, which you could easily do, for you have plenty of ships, and the island is a very good one.

567
00:51:35,436 --> 00:51:40,647
For that the island so fully described here is the Aigadian, or Goat, island of Favoniana.

568
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,088
and that the Cyclopes are the old Cycan inhabitants of Mantegna, Erechs should not be doubted.

569
00:51:46,108 --> 00:52:04,457
The Seventy-Nine Four For the reasons why it was necessary that the night should be so exceptionally dark see the authoress of the Odyssey, P. P. A., one-teen-eight, monty-nine, fourteen-eight, mon-pon-fort-nine, fort-nine-fort, monteen-fort-nine, two-thousand-seventy-nine, one-eight, fort-nine-forten,

570
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:08,427
None but such lambs as would suck if they were with their mothers would be left in the yard.

571
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:10,689
The older lambs should have been out feeding.

572
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,093
The authoress has got it all wrong, but it does not matter.

573
00:52:14,113 --> 00:52:14,914
81.

574
00:52:16,135 --> 00:52:21,321
This line is enclosed in brackets in the received text, and is omitted with note by Messrs.

575
00:52:21,802 --> 00:52:22,703
Butcher and Lang.

576
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:26,968
But lines enclosed in brackets are almost always genuine.

577
00:52:26,948 --> 00:52:35,997
All that brackets mean is that the bracketed passage puzzled some early editor, who nevertheless found it too well established in the text to venture on omitting it.

578
00:52:36,263 --> 00:52:42,450
In the present case, the line bracketed is the very last which a full-grown male editor would be likely to interpolate.

579
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:57,486
It is safer to infer that the writer, a young woman, not knowing or caring at which end of the ship the rudder should be, determined to make sure by placing it at both ends, which we shall find she presently does by repeating it, Lime 3 Fortis, at the stern of the ship.

580
00:52:58,067 --> 00:53:04,093
As for the two rocks thrown, the first I take to be the Assinelli, sea map facing P80.

581
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:10,883
The second I see is the two contiguous islands of the Formiche, which are treated as one, see map facing P108.

582
00:53:11,865 --> 00:53:16,512
The Assinelli is an island shaped like a boat, and pointing to the island of Favagnana.

583
00:53:16,532 --> 00:53:32,376
I think the authoress's compatriots, who probably did not like her much better that she did them, jeered at the absurdity of Ulysses' conduct, and saw the Assinelli, or donkeys, not as the rock thrown by Polyphemus, but as the boat itself containing Ulysses and his men.

584
00:53:38,397 --> 00:53:42,349
This line exists in the text here, but not in the corresponding passage G.

585
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:43,631
41.

586
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:50,841
I am inclined to think it is interpolated, probably by the poetess herself, from the first of lines XI.

587
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:58,371
1.15.37, which I can hardly doubt were added by the writer when the scheme of the work was enlarged and altered.

588
00:53:58,952 --> 00:54:00,614

594
00:54:12,113 --> 00:54:15,636
The island itself, as apart from its inhabitants, was quite normal.

595
00:54:16,277 --> 00:54:24,805
There is no indication of its moving during the month that Ulysses stayed with Aeolus, and on his return from his unfortunate voyage, he seems to have found it in the same place.

596
00:54:25,586 --> 00:54:34,535
The Jari, in fact, should no more be pressed than Tharia as applied to islands, Odyssey XV-299, where they are called flying because the ship would fly past them.

597
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:39,960
So also the Wanderers, as explained by Buttman, see note on Odyssey, see Chai.

237-7, about the Amber Root and the Sacred Way in this connection.

604
00:55:08,307 --> 00:55:22,139
But until he gives his grounds for holding that the Mediterranean peoples in the Odyssean age used to go far north for their amber, instead of getting it in Sicily, where it is still found in considerable quantities, I do not know what weight I ought to attach to his opinion.

605
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,803
I have been unable to find grounds for asserting that B.C.

606
00:55:25,883 --> 00:55:33,089
1000 there was any commerce between the Mediterranean and the far north, but I shall be very ready to learn if Mr. Lang will enlighten me.

One would have thought that when the sun was driving the stag down to the water, Ulysses might have observed its whereabouts.

609
00:55:45,321 --> 00:55:47,263
Ulysses might have observed its whereabouts.

89.

620
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:17,173
Brides presented themselves instinctively to the imagination of the writer as the phase of humanity which she found most interesting.

621
00:56:17,193 --> 00:56:23,921
.92 Ulysses was, in fact, to become a missionary and preach Neptune to people who knew not his name.

622
00:56:23,941 --> 00:56:29,027
I was fortunate enough to meet in Sicily a woman carrying one of these winnowing shovels.

623
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:35,655
It was not much shorter than an oar, and I was able at once to see what the writer of the Odyssey intended.

624
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:36,536
91S.

625
00:56:37,218 --> 00:56:45,291
I suppose the lines I have enclosed in brackets to have been added by the author when she enlarged her original scheme by the addition of books, I.I.I.V.

626
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:46,292

653
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,705
Is the writer a man or a woman?

656
00:58:07,572 --> 00:58:09,254
If 5021, Greek.

657
00:58:10,075 --> 00:58:12,798
The Odyssean line reads, Greek.

658
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:20,786
The famous dactylism, therefore, of the Odyssean line was probably suggested by that of the Iliadic rather than by a desire to accommodate sound to sense.

659
00:58:21,506 --> 00:58:30,996
At any rate, the double coincidence of a dactylic line and an ending Greek seems conclusive as to the familiarity of the writer of the Odyssey with the Iliadic line.

660
00:58:30,976 --> 00:58:31,397
99.

661
00:58:31,677 --> 00:58:41,477
Off the coast of Sicily in South Italy, in the month of May, I have seen men fastened halfway up a boat's mast with their feet resting on a cross-piece, just large enough to support them.

662
00:58:42,338 --> 00:58:44,703
From this point of vantage they spear swordfish.

663
00:58:45,164 --> 00:58:53,440
When I saw men thus employed I could hardly doubt that the writer of the Odyssey had seen others like them and had them in her mind when describing the binding of Ulysses.

664
00:58:53,791 --> 00:59:00,080
I have therefore, with some diffidence, ventured to depart from the received translation of GSEF, Alcaeus-Frag.

665
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,302
18.

666
00:59:01,523 --> 00:59:23,275
Where, however, it is very hard to say what Miastiestiestiestiestiestiestiestiestiestiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiensiens

667
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:25,277
but I have looked for the passage in vain."

668
00:59:25,998 --> 00:59:28,801
The writer is at fault here and tries to put it off on Circe.

669
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:38,050
When Ulysses comes to take the route prescribed by Circe, he ought to pass either the Wanderers or some other difficulty of which we are not told, but he does not do so.

670
00:59:38,651 --> 00:59:50,123
The Plankti, or Wanderers, merge into Scylla and Charybdis, and the alternative between them and something untold merges into the alternative whether Ulysses had better choose Scylla or Charybdis.

671
00:59:50,221 --> 00:59:55,765
Yet from line 260, it seems we are to consider the Wanderers as having been passed by Ulysses.

672
00:59:55,986 --> 00:59:58,577
This appears even more plainly from XXI.

673
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:05,900
327, in which Ulysses expressly mentions the wandering rocks as having been between the Sirens and Scylla and Charybdis.

674
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:11,685
The writer, however, is evidently unaware that she does not quite understand her own story.

675
01:00:12,186 --> 01:00:28,682
Her difficulty was perhaps due to the fact that though Trapanese sailors had given her a fair idea as to where all her other localities really were, no one in those days more than in our own could localize the planktie, which in fact, as Buttman has argued, were derived not from any particular spot,

676
01:00:28,662 --> 01:00:36,878
but from sailors' tales about the difficulties of navigating the group of the Aeolian Islands as a whole, see note on Odd XXIII.

677
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,107
Still the matter of the poor doves caught her fancy, so she would not forgo them.

678
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:48,662
The whirlwinds of fire and the smoke that hangs on Scylla suggest allusion to Stromboli and perhaps even Etna.

679
01:00:49,081 --> 01:00:52,967
Scylla is on the Italian side and therefore may be said to look west.

680
01:00:53,528 --> 01:01:02,583
It is about 8 miles thence to the Sicilian coast, so Ulysses may be perfectly well told that after passing Scylla he will come to the Thranacian island or Sicily.

681
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:07,832
Charybdis is transposed to a site some few miles to the north of its actual position.

682
01:01:11,407 --> 01:01:17,276
I suppose this line to have been intercalated by the author when lines 426-446 were added.

683
01:01:17,296 --> 01:01:18,478
202.

684
01:01:19,479 --> 01:01:30,456
For the reasons which enable us to identify the island of the two sirens with the Lipari island, now Salinas, the ancient Didyme, or Twin Island, see the Authoress of the Odyssey, pp.

685
01:01:30,876 --> 01:01:33,280
95-96.

686
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:46,469
The two sirens doubtless were, as their name suggests, the whistling gusts, or avalanches of air that at times descend without a moment's warning from the two lofty mountains of Salinas, as also from all high points in the neighborhood.

690
01:01:58,004 --> 01:02:04,013
In the islands of Favognana and Maretimo off Trapani, I have seen men fish exactly as here described.

691
01:02:04,494 --> 01:02:09,201
They chew bread into a paste and throw it into the sea to attract the fish, which they then spear.

692
01:02:09,582 --> 01:02:11,164
No line is used.

1005.

695
01:02:14,248 --> 01:02:23,460
The writer evidently regards Ulysses as on a coast that looked east at no great distance south of the Straits of Messina, somewhere, say, near Tauromenium, now Taomina.

01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,421

01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:34,654
Surely there must be a line missing here to tell us that the keel and mast were carried down into Charybdis.

701
01:02:34,634 --> 01:02:38,661
Besides, the Aorist Greek in, in its present surrounding, is perplexing.

702
01:02:39,362 --> 01:02:42,787
I have translated it as though it were an imperfect, I see messes.

703
01:02:43,328 --> 01:02:50,500
Butcher and Lange translate it as a pluperfect, but surely Charybdis was in the act of sucking down the water when Ulysses arrived.

704
01:02:56,369 --> 01:03:02,299
I suppose the passage within brackets to have been an afterthought but to have been written by the same hand as the rest of the poem.

705
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:09,291
I suppose Exi, 1003, to have been also added by the writer when she decided on sending Ulysses back to Charybdis.

706
01:03:09,972 --> 01:03:15,802
The simile suggests the hand of the wife or daughter of a magistrate who had often seen her father come in cross and tired.

The land was in reality the shallow inlet, now the salt works of S. Cusimano.

718
01:04:13,876 --> 01:04:19,625
the neighborhood of Trepani and Mint Eriks being made to do double duty, both as Sheria and Ithaca.

719
01:04:20,266 --> 01:04:36,272
Hence the necessity for making Ulysses set out after dark, fall instantly into a profound sleep, and wake up on a morning so foggy that he could not see anything till the interviews between Neptune and Jove, and between Ulysses and Minerva, should have given the audience time to accept the situation.

720
01:04:36,252 --> 01:04:41,000

721
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:53,762
1011-13 This cave, which is identifiable with singular completeness, is now called the Grotta del Toro, probably a corruption of Tesoro, for it is held to contain a treasure.

729
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:16,955
Doubtless the road would pass the harbour in Odyssean times, as it passes the saltworks now.

730
01:05:17,535 --> 01:05:21,981
Indeed, if there is to be a road at all, there is no other level ground which it could take.

731
01:05:22,642 --> 01:05:24,024
See map above referred to.

732
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:25,986
Night 17.

733
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:37,731
The rock at the end of the northern harbour of Trapani, to which I suppose the writer of the Odyssey to be here referring, still bears the name Malconcilio, the Rock of Evil Council.

734
01:05:37,998 --> 01:05:47,395
There is a legend that it was a ship of Turkish pirates who were intending to attack Trapani, but the Madonna di Trapani crushed them under this rock just as they were coming into port.

735
01:05:48,036 --> 01:05:59,297
My friend Cavaliere Gianni Trapani of Trapani told me that his father used to tell him when he was a boy that if he would drop exactly three drops of oil onto the water near the rock, he would see the ship still at the bottom.

736
01:05:59,277 --> 01:06:08,506
The legend is evidently a Christianized version of the Odyssean story, while the name supplies the additional detail that the disaster happened in consequence of an evil council.

737
01:06:09,286 --> 01:06:09,707
The Fort.

738
01:06:10,187 --> 01:06:10,708
119.

739
01:06:12,089 --> 01:06:15,992
It would seem then that the ship had got all the way back from Ithaca in about a quarter of an hour.

740
01:06:16,012 --> 01:06:17,194
119.

741
01:06:17,814 --> 01:06:24,660
And may we not add, and also to prevent his recognizing that he was only in the place where he had met Nausicaa two days earlier.

742
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,382
220.

743
01:06:26,902 --> 01:06:41,245
All this is to excuse the entire absence of Minerva from books XWY, XWYN, which XWYN, which XWYN, which XWY'd Minerva before the authoress had determined on making Minerva so prominent a character.

744
01:06:41,826 --> 01:06:42,767
21.

745
01:06:42,747 --> 01:06:43,128

746
01:06:43,788 --> 01:06:48,816
We have met with this somewhat lame attempt to cover the writer's change of scheme at the end of BK.

747
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:49,957
VU 22.

748
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:53,562
I take the following from The Authoress of the Odyssey.

749
01:06:54,003 --> 01:06:54,243

1007.

752
01:06:57,127 --> 01:06:59,791
It is clear from the text that there were two caves.

753
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:04,738
Not one, but someone has enclosed in brackets the two lines in which the second cave is mentioned,

754
01:07:04,718 --> 01:07:11,249
I presume because he found himself puzzled by having a second cave sprung upon him, when up to this point he had only been told of one.

755
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:19,723
I venture to think that if he had known the ground he would not have been puzzled, for there are two caves, distant about eighty or one hundred yards from one another.

756
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:26,628
The cave in which Ulysses hid his treasure is, as I have already said, identifiable with singular completeness.

757
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:32,136
The other cave presents no special features, neither in the poem nor in nature.

758
01:07:32,156 --> 01:07:33,678
12.30.

759
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:38,625
There is no attempt to disguise the fact that Penelope had long given encouragement to the suitors.

760
01:07:39,146 --> 01:07:43,011
The only defense set up is that she did not really mean to encourage them.

761
01:07:42,991 --> 01:07:45,736
Would it not have been wiser to have tried a little discouragement?

762

The real reason for sending Telemachus to Pylos and Lacedaemon was that the Authoress might get Helen of Troy into her poem.

776
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:19,134
He was sent at the only point in the story at which he could be sent, so he must have gone then, or not at all.

777
01:08:19,655 --> 01:08:30,966
12106, Thousing Chamity Seas, the site I assigned to Eumaeus' hut, close to the Irukazide Corvi, is about 2,000 feet above the sea and commands an extensive view.

01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:33,028
1227.

779
01:08:34,274 --> 01:08:38,360
Sandals, such as Eumaeus was making, are still worn in the Abruzzi and elsewhere.

780
01:08:39,001 --> 01:08:48,295
An oblong piece of leather forms the sole, holes are cut at the four corners, and through these holes, leathern straps are passed, which are bound round the foot and cross-guarded of the calf.

785
01:09:16,464 --> 01:09:21,274
The dress was kept at the bottom of the chest as one that would only be wanted on the greatest occasions.

786
01:09:21,254 --> 01:09:32,790
But surely the marriage of Hermione and of Megapenthe's EPK-EV4-OV10, Ini, might have induced Helen to wear it on the preceding evening, in which case it could hardly have got back.

787
01:09:33,271 --> 01:09:35,894

Mines 134, the names Syra and Ortigia, on which island a great part of the Doric Syracuse was originally built, suggest that even in Odyssean times there was a prehistoric Syracuse, the existence of which was known to the writer of the poem.

794
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:05,541
35.

795
01:10:06,262 --> 01:10:08,746
Literally, where are the turnings of the sun?

796
01:10:09,808 --> 01:10:11,511
Assuming, as we may safely do,

797
01:10:11,812 --> 01:10:26,070
that the Syra and Ortigia of the Odyssey refer to Syracuse, it is the fact that not far to the south of these places the land turned sharply round, so that mariners following the coast would find the sun upon the other side of their ship, to that on which they'd had it hitherto.

798
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:29,995
Mr. A. S. Griffith has kindly called my attention to Herod I.

799
01:10:30,015 --> 01:10:36,283
42, where, speaking of the circumnavigation of Africa by Phoenician mariners under Nekos, he writes,

800
01:10:36,263 --> 01:10:43,793
On their return they declared, I for my part do not believe them, but perhaps others may, that in sailing round Libya, i.e.

801
01:10:43,893 --> 01:10:46,136
Africa, they had the sun upon their right hand.

802
01:10:46,877 --> 01:10:49,540
In this way was the extent of Libya first discovered.

803
01:10:50,101 --> 01:10:59,773
I take it that Eumaeus was made to have come from Syracuse because the writer thought she rather ought to have made something happen at Syracuse during her account of the voyages of Ulysses.

804
01:10:59,753 --> 01:11:04,843
She could not, however, break his long drift from Charybdis to the island of Pantelaria.

805
01:11:05,264 --> 01:11:08,370
She therefore resolved to make it up to Syracuse in another way.

806
01:11:09,071 --> 01:11:14,783
Modern excavations established the existence of two and only two pre-Dorian communities at Syracuse.

807
01:11:15,123 --> 01:11:19,973
They were, so Dr. Orsi informed me, at Plamirio and Coso Pantano.

These words cannot mean that it would be afternoon soon after they were spoken.

831
01:12:36,925 --> 01:12:41,110
Ulysses and Eumaeus reached the town which was some way off, Exbiae.

832
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,354
Twenty-five in time for the suitor's early meal, Exbiae.

833
01:12:46,455 --> 01:12:51,060
Seventy-o and one-sixth Eumaeus conjured seventy-sixth say at ten or eleven o'clock.

834
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,222
The context of the rest of the book shows this.

835
01:12:54,023 --> 01:12:58,067
Eumaeus and Ulysses therefore cannot have started later than eight or nine,

836
01:12:58,047 --> 01:13:03,715
and Eumaeus' words must be taken as an exaggeration for the purpose of making Ulysses bestir himself.

I imagine the fountain to have been somewhere about where the church of the Madonna di Trapani now stands, and to have been fed with water from what is now called the Fontana di Fali on Mantierix.

840
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:34,146
From this and other passages in the Odyssey, it appears that we are in an age anterior to the use of coined money, an age when cauldrons, tripods, swords, cattle, chattels of all kinds, measures of corn, wine, or oil, etc.,

841
01:13:34,126 --> 01:13:34,807

01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:43,759
not to say pieces of gold, silver, bronze, or even iron, wrought more or less, but unstamped, were the nearest approach to a currency that had as yet been reached.

I correct these proofs abroad, and am not within reach of Hesiod, but surely this passage suggests acquaintance with the works and ways, though it by no means compels it.

849
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,264

It is plain, therefore, that Iris was commonly accepted as the messenger of the gods, though our authoress will never permit her to fetch or carry for anyone.

These, I imagine, must have been in the open part of the inner courtyard, where the maids also stood, and threw the light of their torches into the covered cloister that ran all round it.

An additional and well-marked feature being wanted to convince Penelope, the writer has taken the hunched shoulders of Thursites, who is mentioned immediately after Euripides in the Iliad, and put them on to Euripides' back.

868
01:15:09,261 --> 01:15:15,430
This is how geese are now fed in Sicily, at any rate in summer, when the grass is all burnt up.

01:15:22,506 --> 01:15:29,621
Eurycleia says it was herself that had thrown the cloak over Ulysses, for the plural should not be taken as implying more than one person.

873
01:15:30,162 --> 01:15:35,494
The writer is evidently still fluctuating between Eurycleia and Eurynemy as the name for the old nurse.

874
01:15:35,474 --> 01:15:51,255
She probably originally meant to call her Euryclea, but finding it not immediately easy to make Euryclea scan an XVI, 495, she hastily called her Urinami, intending either to alter this name later, or to change the earlier Eurycleas into Urinami.

875
01:15:51,235 --> 01:16:06,201
She then drifted into Eurynome as convenience further directed, still nevertheless hankering after Eurycleia, till at last she found that the path of least resistance would lie in the direction of making Eurynome and Eurycleia two persons, therefore in XXII.

876
01:16:06,602 --> 01:16:13,193
289-292 both Eurynome and the nurse, who can be none other than Eurycleia, come on together.

877
01:16:13,173 --> 01:16:16,649

This is the only allusion to Sardinia in either Iliad or Odyssey.

01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:07,881
The normal translation of the Greek word would be holding back, curbing, restraining, but I cannot think that the writer meant this.

887
01:17:08,421 --> 01:17:14,547
She must have been using the word in its other sense of having, holding, keeping, maintaining, W161-92.

907
01:17:59,152 --> 01:18:01,916
Surely the difficulty of this passage has been overrated.

908
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:10,407
I suppose the iron part of the axe to have been wedged into the handle, or bound securely to it, the handle being half buried in the ground.

909
01:18:10,387 --> 01:18:18,916
The axe would be placed edgeways towards the archer, and he would have to shoot his arrow through the hole into which the handle was fitted when the axe was in use.

910
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:29,408
Twelve axes were placed in a row all at the same height, all exactly in front of one another, all edgeways to Ulysses whose arrow passed through all the holes from the first onward.

911
01:18:29,868 --> 01:18:34,754
I cannot see how the Greek can bear any other interpretation, the words being Greekic.

912
01:18:35,114 --> 01:18:37,677
He did not miss a single hole from the first onwards.

913
01:18:38,197 --> 01:18:49,177
Greek Acre, according to Liddell and Scott, being the hole for the handle of an axe, etc., while Greek Acre, Acre Obedic, Reek Acre Odd, V236, is, according to the same authorities, the handle itself.

914
01:18:49,778 --> 01:18:55,108
The feat is absurdly impossible, but our authoress sometimes has a soul above impossibilities.

It is strange that the author of the Iliad should find a little horsehair so alarming.

924
01:19:21,971 --> 01:19:29,198
Possibly enough she was merely borrowing a common form line from some earlier poet or poetess, for this is a woman's line rather than a man's.

the pavement on which Ulysses was standing.

930
01:19:40,549 --> 01:19:41,970
The interpretation of lines.

931
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:56,812
The interpretation of lines 126-43 is most dubious, and at best we are in a region of melodrama, CF, however, I-425, etc., from which it appears that there was a tower in the outer court, and that Telemachus used to sleep in it.

932
01:19:57,533 --> 01:20:11,485
The cumbershoe, if I take to be a door, or trapdoor, leading on to the roof above Telemachus' bedroom, which we are told was in a place that could be seen from all round, or it might be simply a window in Telemachus' room, looking out into the street.

933
01:20:11,465 --> 01:20:15,581
From the top of the tower, the outer world was to be told what was going on.

934
01:20:16,063 --> 01:20:18,754
But people could not get in by the Taimasa'ing jaan.

935
01:20:19,095 --> 01:20:21,103
They would have to come in by the main entrance.

936
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:32,737
and Melanthius explains that the mouth of the narrow passage, which was in the lands of Ulysses and his friends, commanded the only entrance by which help could come, so that there would be nothing gained by raising an alarm.

937
01:20:33,258 --> 01:20:44,914
As for the seatory of line 143, no commentator ancient or modern has been able to say what was intended, but whatever they were, Melanthius could never carry twelve shields, twelve helmets, and twelve spears.

938
01:20:45,575 --> 01:20:49,200
Moreover, where he could go, the others could go also.

939
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:59,343
If a dozen suitors had followed Melanthius into the house, they could have attacked Ulysses in the rear, in which case, unless Minerva had intervened promptly, the odyssey would have had a different ending.

940
01:21:00,004 --> 01:21:04,354
But throughout the scene, we are in a region of extravagance rather than of true fiction.

941
01:21:04,857 --> 01:21:12,888
It cannot be taken seriously by any but the very serious, until we come to the episode of Phemius and Medon, where the writer begins to be at home again.

943
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:19,156

01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:46,896

953
01:21:46,876 --> 01:21:55,948
500-502 Ulysses scolded Eurycleia for offering information on this very point, and declared himself quite able to settle it for himself.

954
01:21:57,109 --> 01:21:57,490

959
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:14,031
Lord Grimthorpe, whose understanding does not lend itself to easy imposition, has been good enough to write to me about my conviction that the Odyssey was written by a woman,

960
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:18,042
and to send me remarks upon the gross absurdity of the incident here recorded.

961
01:22:18,062 --> 01:22:22,514
It is plain that all the authoress cared about was that the women should be hanged.

962
01:22:22,875 --> 01:22:29,573
As for attempting to realize, or to make her readers realize, how the hanging was done, this was of no consequence.

963
01:22:29,553 --> 01:22:32,499
The reader must take her word for it and ask no questions.

964
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:42,959
Lord Grimthorpe wrote, I had better send you my ideas about Nausicaa's hanging of the maids, not maidens, of whom Frood wrote so well in his Science of History before I forget it all.

965
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:49,091
Luckily for me, Liddell and Scott have specially translated most of the doubtful words referring to this very place.

966
01:22:49,992 --> 01:22:51,375
A ship's cable.

967
01:22:51,355 --> 01:23:04,834
I don't know how big a ship she meant, but it must have been a very small one indeed, if its cables could be used to tie tightly round a woman's neck, and still more round a dozen of them in a row, besides being strong enough to hold them and pull them all up.

968
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:16,030
A dozen average women would need the weight and strength of more than a dozen strong, heavy men, even over the best pulley hung to the roof over them, and the idea of pulling them up by a rope hung anyhow round a pillar,

969
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:24,505
Greek is absurdly impossible, and how a dozen of them could be hung dangling round one post is a problem which a senior wrangler would be puzzled to answer.

970
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:29,653
She had better have let Telemachus use his sword as he had intended till she changed his mind for him.

Ulysses's bedroom does not appear to have been upstairs, nor yet quite within the house.

Is it possible that it was the domed room round the outside of which the erring-maids were, for aught we have heard to the contrary, still hanging?

So practice to wash a woman, as our authoress doubtless knew that, by this time, the web must have become such a wreck that it would have gone to pieces in the wash.

997
01:24:54,830 --> 01:25:11,640
A lady points out to me, just as these sheets are leaving my hands, that no really good needlewoman, no one, indeed, whose work or character was worth consideration, could have endured, no matter for what reason, the unpicking of her day's work, day after day, for between three and four years.

We must suppose Dolius not yet to know that his son Melanthius had been tortured, mutilated, and left to die by Ulysses' orders on the preceding day, and that his daughter Melantho had been hanged.

1000
01:25:24,538 --> 01:25:28,805
Dolius was probably exceptionally simple-minded, and his name was ironical.

1001
01:25:29,405 --> 01:25:37,577
So, on my Tidrix, the first-of-first-of-first-of-firstie, was called Sonsa Malacia, or Guiless, he being held exceptionally cunning.

General Information About Project Gutenbergi Electronic Works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergi concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.

Project Gutenbergene e-books are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the US, unless a copyright notice is included.
