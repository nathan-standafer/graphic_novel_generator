00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:06,257
CHAPTER XIV NANTUCKET Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so.

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,771
After a fine run we safely arrived in Nantucket.

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,961
Nantucket, take out your map and look at it.

4
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:21,233
See what a real corner of the world it occupies, how it stands there, a way offshore, more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse.

5
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:27,823
Look at it, a mere hillock, an elbow of sand, all beach, without a background.

6
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:34,393
There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper.

7
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:37,938
Some gamesome whites will tell you that they have to plant weeds there.

8
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,420
They don't grow naturally.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,722
That they import Canada thistles.

10
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:45,866
They have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask.

11
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:50,670
That pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the True Cross in Rome.

12
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:55,515
That people there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summertime.

13
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:59,878
That that wade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day's walk of prairie.

14
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:03,201
That they wear quicksand shoes, something like Laplander snowshoes.

15
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:04,423
That, that, tot, that.

16
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:09,407
But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.

17
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:14,619
Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the Red Men.

18
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:16,764
Thus goes the legend.

19
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:21,355
In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast.

20
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,329
and carried off an infant Indian in his talons.

21
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:30,417
With loud lament the parents saw their child born out of sight over the wide waters.

22
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:35,784
They resolved to follow in the same direction, setting out in their canoes.

23
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:44,895
After a perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket, the poor little Indian's skeleton.

24
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:53,055
What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take to the sea for a livelihood.

25
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:56,502
They first caught crabs and quahogs in the sand-grown boulder.

26
00:01:56,963 --> 00:02:00,170
They waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced.

27
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,395
They pushed off in boats and captured cod.

28
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:13,155
and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explore this watery world, put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it, at Beepton, at Bering Strait, Straits Undone.

29
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:22,813
In all seasons, in all oceans, declare an everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood, Mus Mostas, and Mus Mountainous.

30
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:35,096
that Himalayan salt-sea mastodon clothes with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults.

31
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,705
And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea-hermits,

32
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:55,006
issuing from their anthill in the sea, overrun and conquer the watery world like so many Alexanders, parceling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland.

33
00:02:55,126 --> 00:03:02,757
Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada, let the English overswarm all India,

34
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:05,282
And hang out their blazing banner from the sun.

35
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:17,045
Two-thirds of this tarracuous globe Are the Nantucketers, for the sea is his, he owns it, As emperors own empires, other seamen Having but a right of way through it.

36
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:20,712
Merchant ships are but extension bridges,

37
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:25,079
armed ones, but floating forts, even pirates and privateers.

38
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:37,698
Though following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless, deep itself.

39
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:45,450
In Antarctica, he alone resides, and riots on the sea he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships.

40
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,538
To, and Fro, ploughing it as his own special plantation.

41
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:50,560
There is his home.

42
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:58,595
There lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.

43
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:02,463
He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie.

44
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:07,793
He hides among the waves, he climbs them, as shammy hunters climb the Alps.

45
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:18,673
For years he knows not the land, so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman.

46
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:37,088
With a landless gall that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows, so at nightfall the Nanta Keter, out of sight of land, furls his sails and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.
