Chapter 14 - Nantucket

2
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:10,062
Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning, so, after a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.

3
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:11,404
Nantucket!

4
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:13,386
Take out your map and look at it.

5
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:21,294
See what a real corner of the world it occupies, how it stands there, away offshore, more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse.

6
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:26,819
Look at it, a mere hillock, an elbow of sand, all beach, without a background.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,805
There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper.

8
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:49,225
Some gamesome whites will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they don't grow naturally, that they import Canada thistles, that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask, that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the True Cross in Rome.

9
00:00:49,913 --> 00:01:11,770
that people there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summertime, that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day's walk, a prairie, that they wear quicksand shoes, something like Laplander snowshoes, that they are so shut up, belted about, every way enclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean.

10
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,341
that to their very charity, but these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.

11
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:22,873
Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the Red Men.

12
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:24,816
Thus goes the legend.

13
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:32,492
In olden times, an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast and carried off an infant Indian in his talons.

14
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:36,818
With loud lament the parents saw their child born out of sight over the wide waters.

15
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,782
They resolved to follow in the same direction.

16
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:49,036
Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket, the poor little Indian skeleton.

17
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:55,645
What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take to the sea for a livelihood.

18
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:58,491
They first caught crabs and quoll hogs in the sand.

19
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,839
Grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel.

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,527
More experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod.

21
00:02:05,848 --> 00:02:14,427
And at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world, put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it.

22
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:25,260
peeped in at Bering Straits, and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood, most monstrous and most mountainous.

23
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:38,035
That Himalayan, Salt Sea Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults.

24
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:55,436
And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from their anthill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders, parceling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland.

25
00:02:56,136 --> 00:03:00,442
Let America add Mexico to Texas and pile Cuba upon Canada.

26
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:06,469
Let the English overswarm all India and hang out their blazing banner from the sun.

27
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:09,594
Two-thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketers.

28
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:17,866
For the sea is his, he owns it, as emperors own empires, other seamen having but a right of way through it.

29
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:36,152
Merchant ships are but extension bridges, armed ones but floating forts, even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen, the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself.

30
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:40,727
The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea.

31
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:47,754
He alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships, to and fro plowing it as his own special plantation.

32
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:49,616
Vier is his home.

33
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:57,584
Vier lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.

34
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,368
He lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie.

35
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,210
He hides among the waves.

36
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:06,814
He climbs the Mishamoa hunters climb the Alps.

37
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:15,891
For years he knows not the land, so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman.

38
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:22,002
With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows.

39
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:32,802
So at nightfall the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.
