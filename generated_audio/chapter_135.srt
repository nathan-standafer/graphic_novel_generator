00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:18,259
Chapter 135 - The Chase-Third Day. The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary nightman at the four-mast head was relieved by crowds of the daylight lookouts, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.

2
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,943
"'Di see him,' cried Ahab, but the whale was not yet in sight.

3
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:26,129
"'In his infallible wake, though, but follow that wake, that's all.

4
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,833
Helm there, steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.

5
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:31,655
What a lovely day again!

6
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:41,327
Were it a new-made world and made for a summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,544
Here's food for thought, had Ahab time to think.

8
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:46,788
But Ahab never thinks.

9
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:49,353
He only feels, feels, feels, feels.

10
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:52,999
That's tingling enough for mortal man to think's audacity.

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,784
God only has that right and privilege.

12
00:00:56,405 --> 00:01:04,800
Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness, and our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much for that.

13
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,405
And yet, I've sometimes thought my brain was very calm, frozen calm.

14
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:15,392
This old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turn to ice and shiver it.

15
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:20,757
And still this hair is growing now, this moment growing, and heat must breed it.

16
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:29,607
But no, it's like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava.

17
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:36,301
How the wild winds blow it, they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to.

18
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:48,186
A vile wind that has no doubt blown e'er this, through prison corridors and cells and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.

19
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:48,947
Out upon it.

20
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:50,229
It's tainted.

21
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,496
Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world.

22
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:57,501
I'd crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there.

23
00:01:58,122 --> 00:02:01,146
And yet, tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind.

24
00:02:01,848 --> 00:02:05,974
Whoever conquered it, in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow.

25
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:09,820
Run tilting at it, and you but run through it.

26
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:10,572
Ha!

27
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:22,691
a coward wind that strikes stark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow, even Ahab is a braver thing, a nobler thing than that, would now the wind but had a body.

28
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:33,006
But all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as agents.

29
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,568
There's a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference.

30
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:40,920
And yet I say again and swear it now.

31
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,984
that there's something all-glorious and gracious in the wind.

32
00:02:44,745 --> 00:03:04,410
These warm trade winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness, and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippis of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last.

33
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,033
and by the eternal poles.

34
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:19,224
These same trades that so directly blow my good ship on, these trades, or something like them, something so unchangeable and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along.

35
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:20,124
To it.

36
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,547
Aloft there, what d'I see?

37
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:24,088
Nothing, sir.

38
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:26,530
Nothing, and noon at hand.

39
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:29,393
The doubloon goes a-begging.

40
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:30,554
See the sun.

41
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:33,196
Ay, ay, it must be so.

42
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,258
I've over-sailed him.

43
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:36,580
How got the start?

44
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:38,822
Aye, he's chasing M.E.

45
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:40,324
now, not I, him.

46
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:43,268
That's bad, I might have known it too.

47
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:44,269
Fool!

48
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,032
The lines, the harpoons he's towing.

49
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,836
Aye, aye, I have run him by last night.

50
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:50,877
About!

51
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:51,658
About!

52
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:52,479
About!

53
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,963
Come down, all of ye, but the regular lookouts.

54
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:57,505
Man the braces!

55
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:10,469
Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she returned the cream in her own white wake.

56
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:18,964
Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw, murmured Starbuck to himself as he coiled the new-hauled main brace upon the rail.

57
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:24,513
God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh.

58
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:28,200
I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him.

59
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:33,429
Stand by to sway me up, cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.

60
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:34,771
We should meet him soon.

61
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:36,294
Aye, aye, sir.

62
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:41,863
And straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and once more Ahab swung on high.

63
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:45,620
A whole hour now passed, gold beaten out to ages.

64
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:49,587
Time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense.

65
00:04:50,388 --> 00:05:01,708
But at last, some three points off the weather-bow, Ahab described the spout again, and instantly, from the three mast-heads, three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.

66
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:05,161
Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick!

67
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:06,544
On deck there.

68
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:07,967
Brace sharper up.

69
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:09,611
Crowd her into the wind's eye.

70
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:12,657
He's too far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck.

71
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:14,522
The sails shake.

72
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,947
Stand over that helmsman with a top maul.

73
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,811
So, so, he travels fast and I must down.

74
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:24,276
But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea, there's time for that.

75
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:31,466
An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young, aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it.

76
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,369
A boy, from the sand hills of Nantucket.

77
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,715
The same, the same, the same to Noah as to me.

78
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:40,419
There's a soft shower to leeward.

79
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,243
Such lovely leewardings.

80
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:43,686
They must lead somewhere.

81
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,670
To something else than common land.

82
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,394
More palmy than the palms.

83
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:48,416
Leeward.

84
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:50,300
The white whale goes that way.

85
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,302
Look to windward, then.

86
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:53,246
The better if the bitterer quarter.

87
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,712
But good-bye, good-bye, old masthead.

88
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:57,295
What's this?

89
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:57,716
green?

90
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:00,661
Ay, tiny mosses in these warped cracks.

91
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:03,566
No such green weather stains on Ahab's head.

92
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:06,932
There's the difference now between man's old age and matters.

93
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:10,198
But ay, old mast, we both grow old together.

94
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,902
Sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship?

95
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:15,006
Ay, minus a leg, that's all.

96
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:19,654
By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way.

97
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:28,058
I can't compare with it, and I've known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers.

98
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:29,499
What's that, he said?

99
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,505
He should still go before me, my pilot, and yet to be seen again?

100
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:34,607
But where?

101
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:39,634
Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs?

102
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,219
And all night I've been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to?

103
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,407
Ay, ay, like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching thyself, O Parsi.

104
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,353
But, Ahab, there thy shot fell short.

105
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,617
Goodbye, masthead.

106
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:58,149
Keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone.

107
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:05,352
We'll talk tomorrow, nay, tonight, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.

108
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:12,063
He gave the word, and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck.

109
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:24,302
In due time the boats were lowered, but as standing in his shallop stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the mate, who held one of the tackle ropes on deck and bade him pause.

110
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:25,443
Starbuck, sir?

111
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:29,568
For the third time my sole ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.

112
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,410
Ay, sir, thou wilt have it so.

113
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:35,575
Some ships sail from their ports and ever afterwards are missing, Starbuck.

114
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:37,116
Truth, sir, saddest truth.

115
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:42,322
Some men die at ebb tide, some at low water, some at the full of the flood.

116
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:46,567
And I feel now like a billow that's all one crested comb, Starbuck.

117
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:47,528
I am old.

118
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:48,970
Shake hands with me, man.

119
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:53,715
Their hands met, their eyes fastened, Starbuck's tears the glue.

120
00:07:53,763 --> 00:08:00,011
Oh, my captain, my captain, my captain, noble heart, go not, go not, go not.

121
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:02,635
See, it's a brave man that weeps.

122
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:05,158
How great the agony of the persuasion then.

123
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:09,384
Lower away, cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm from him.

124
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:10,786
Stand by the crew.

125
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:14,491
In an instant, the boat was pulling round close under the stern.

126
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:18,856
The sharks, the sharks, cried a voice from the low cabin window there.

127
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,660
Oh, master, my master, come back.

128
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:27,100
But Ahab heard nothing, for his own voice was high-lifted then, and the boat leaped on.

129
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:44,745
Yet the voice spake true, for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they dipped in the water, and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites.

130
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:57,077
It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale boats in those swarming seas, the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east.

131
00:08:57,718 --> 00:09:13,753
But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the white whale had been first described, and whether it was that Ahab's crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks, a matter sometimes well known to affect them,

132
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:18,495
However it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.

133
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:25,508
heart of wrought steel," murmured Starbuck, gazing over the side, and following with his eyes the receding boat.

134
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:28,511
Canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight?

135
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:36,979
Lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase, and this the critical third day.

136
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,748
For when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit, be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon,

137
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:47,972
and the third the evening in the end of that thing.

138
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:49,816
Be that end what it may.

139
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:59,113
Oh, my God, what is this that shoots through me and leaves me so deadly calm yet expectant, fixed at the top of a shutter?

140
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:06,066
Future things swim before me as in empty outlines and skeletons, all the past has somehow grown dim.

141
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:10,372
Mary, girl, thou fadest in pale glories behind me, boy.

142
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:13,998
I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue.

143
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:18,485
Strangest problems of life seem clearing, but clouds sweep between.

144
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:20,528
Is my journey's end coming?

145
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,455
My legs feel faint, like his who has footed it all day.

146
00:10:25,435 --> 00:10:27,157
Feel thy heart, beats it yet.

147
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,082
Stir thyself, starbuck, stave it off.

148
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,265
Move, move, speak aloud.

149
00:10:33,026 --> 00:10:36,290
Masthead there, see ye my boy's hand on the hill.

150
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,897
Crazed, aloft there, keep thy keenest eye upon the boats.

151
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:42,459
Mark well the whale.

152
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,423
Ho, again, drive off that hawk.

153
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,066
See, he pecks.

154
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:51,432
He tears the vein, pointing to the red flag flying at the main truck.

155
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:53,755
Ha, he soars away with it.

156
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:54,978
Where's the old man now?

157
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:57,144
Seest thou that sight, O Ahab?

158
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:58,247
Shudder, shudder!"

159
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:07,069
The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mastheads, a downward-pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded.

160
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:20,609
But intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel, the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow.

161
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,737
Drive, drive in your nails, O ye waves, to their uttermost heads drive them in.

162
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:32,869
Ye but strike a thing without a lid, and no coffin and no hearse can be mine, and hemp only can kill me.

163
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,812
Ha, ha!

164
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:45,656
Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles, then quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising to the surface.

165
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:59,753
A low rumbling sound was heard, a subterraneous hum, and then all held their breaths, as bedraggled with trailing ropes and harpoons and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.

166
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:08,418
Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air, and then fell swamping back into the deep.

167
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:21,775
Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.

168
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:22,876
Give way!"

169
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:35,207
cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the attack, but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby Dick seemed combinely possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven.

170
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:43,189
The wide tears of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together.

171
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:57,991
As head on, he came turning his tail among the boats, and once more flailed them apart, spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates' boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.

172
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:04,300
While Dagu and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks, and as the whale swimming out from them, turned,

173
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,044
and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again.

174
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:22,428
At that moment a quick cry went up, lashed round and round to the fish's back, pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him, the half-torn body of the Parsi was seen.

175
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:28,617
His sable raiment frayed to shreds, his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.

176
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,301
The harpoon dropped from his hand.

177
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:41,846
Befooled, befooled, Drawing in a long, lean breath, I, Parsee, I see thee again, I, and thou goest before, And this, T.H.I.

178
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:44,732
this, then, is the hearse That thou didst promise.

179
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:47,434
But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word.

180
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:49,319
Where is the second hearse?

181
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,305
Away, mates, to the ship.

182
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:53,210
Those boats are useless now.

183
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,035
Repair them if ye can in time.

184
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:58,866
And return to me, if not, Ahab is enough to die.

185
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:00,831
Down, men!

186
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:05,813
The first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon.

187
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:09,957
Ye are not other men but my arms and my legs, and so obey me.

188
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:11,259
Where's the whale?

189
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,380
Gone down again?

190
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:23,393
But he looked too nigh the boat, for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage.

191
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:33,826
Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward, and had almost passed the ship, which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.

192
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:40,895
He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.

193
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:47,524
Oh, Ahab, cried Starbuck, not too late is it, even now, the third day, to desist.

194
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:49,927
See, Moby Dick seeks thee not.

195
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,211
It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him.

196
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:59,580
Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward by both oars and canvas.

197
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:13,309
And at last, when Ahab was sliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's face as he leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval.

198
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:26,233
Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Kwekweg, and Dagu eagerly mounting to the three mastheads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them.

199
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:36,613
One after the other through the portholes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stuv and Flask busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances.

200
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:43,285
As he saw all this, as he heard the hammers and the broken boats, far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.

201
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:44,548
But he rallied.

202
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:57,572
And now marking that the vein or flag was gone from the main mast head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.

203
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:18,160
whether fagged by the three days' running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore, or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him, whichever was true, the white whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more, though indeed the whale's last start had not been so long a one as before.

204
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:35,912
And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him, and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat, and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost every dip.

205
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:40,357
Heed them not, those teeth, but give new Rolox to your oars.

206
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:44,583
Pull on, tis the better rest, the shark's jaw than the yielding water.

207
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:48,728
But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller.

208
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:50,311
They will last long enough.

209
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:51,132
Pull on.

210
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:52,554
But who can tell?"

211
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:53,475
he muttered.

212
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:57,681
Whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab,

213
00:16:57,661 --> 00:16:58,383
But pull on!

214
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:00,430
Ay, all alive now!

215
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,513
We near him!

216
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:02,516
The helm!

217
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:03,580
Take the helm!

218
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,463
Let me pass!

219
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:09,358
And so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still-flying boat.

220
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:19,672
At length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along with the white whale's flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance, as the whale sometimes will.

221
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:27,803
And Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled round his great manadnock hump.

222
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:36,595
He was even thus close to him, when, with body arched back and both arms lengthwise high lifted to the poise, he darted his fierce iron,

223
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:41,080
and his far fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale.

224
00:17:41,841 --> 00:18:01,502
As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed, spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gun-whale to which he then clung,

225
00:18:01,482 --> 00:18:04,433
Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea.

226
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:12,403
As it was, three of the oarsmen, who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its effects,

227
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:26,620
These were flung out, but so fell that, in an instant two of them clutched the gun-whale again, and rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again, the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.

228
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:36,113
Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated, instantaneous swiftness, the white whale darted through the weltering sea.

229
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:46,018
But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and hold it so, and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark,

230
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:51,087
The moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air.

231
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:52,509
What breaks in me?

232
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:58,215
Some sinew cracks, tis hull again, oars, oars, burst in upon him.

233
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:05,324
Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay.

234
00:19:05,804 --> 00:19:14,655
But in that evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship, seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions, bethinking it,

235
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:25,101
It may be, a larger and nobler foe, of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prowl, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

236
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:28,377
Ahab staggered, his hands smote his forehead.

237
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:33,727
I grow blind, hands, stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way.

238
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:38,395
Isn't night, the whale, the ship, cried the cringing oarsman.

239
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:39,918
Oars, oars!

240
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,067
Slog downwards to thy depths, O sea, that erred be for ever too late.

241
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:49,435
Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark.

242
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:51,417
I see the ship, the ship!

243
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,698
Dash on, my men!

244
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,800
Will ye not save my ship?

245
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,501
Dash on, my men!

246
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,643
Will ye not save my ship?

247
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:18,780
But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledgehammering seas, the before-whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves, its half-waiting, splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bail out the pouring water.

248
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:39,148
Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego's masthead hammer remained suspended in his hand, and the red flag, half-wrapping him as with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him as his own forward-flowing heart, while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon as he.

249
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:40,608
The whale!

250
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:41,350
The whale!

251
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:42,091
Uphelm!

252
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:42,753
Uphelm!

253
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:43,535
Uphelm!

254
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:47,143
O, all ye sweet powers of air, now hug me close!

255
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:51,813
Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman's fainting fit.

256
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:53,357
Uphelm, I say!

257
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:54,319
Ye fools!

258
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:54,940
The jaw!

259
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,243
The jaw!

260
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,546
Is this the end of all my bursting prayers?

261
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:00,488
All my lifelong fidelities?

262
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:03,632
O Ahab, Ahab, lo thy work!

263
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:05,715
Steady, helmsman, steady!

264
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:07,657
Nay, nay, uphelm again!

265
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:08,979
He turns to meet us.

266
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,546
O his unappeasable brow drives on towards one whose duty tells him he cannot depart.

267
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,589
My God, stand by me now.

268
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:21,775
Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help Stubb.

269
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:23,263
For Stub, too, sticks here.

270
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:25,795
I grin at thee, thou grinning whale.

271
00:21:26,438 --> 00:21:30,398
Whoever helped Stub or kept Stub awake but Stub's own unwinking eye.

272
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:34,326
and now poor stub goes to bed upon a mattress that is all too soft.

273
00:21:34,806 --> 00:21:36,128
Would it were stuffed with brushwood.

274
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,351
I grin at thee, thou grinning whale.

275
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:40,694
Look ye, sun, moon, and stars.

276
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:44,880
I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost.

277
00:21:45,481 --> 00:21:48,965
For all that I would yet wring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup.

278
00:21:49,686 --> 00:21:54,833
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, thou grinning whale, but there'll be plenty of gulping soon.

279
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,497
Why fly ye not, O Ahab?

280
00:21:56,878 --> 00:22:00,246
For me, off shoes and jacket to it, Let stub die in his drawers.

281
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,354
A most mouldy and over-salted death, though.

282
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:04,136
Cherries!

283
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:04,818
Cherries!

284
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:05,419
Cherries!

285
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,041
Cherries!

286
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:06,802
Cherries!

287
00:22:06,923 --> 00:22:07,404
Cherries!

288
00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:07,985
Cherries!

289
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:08,647
Cherries!

290
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:09,168
Cherries!

291
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:09,690
Cherries!

292
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,712
Cherries!

293
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:14,159
O flask, for one red cherry ere we die!

294
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,526
Cherries, I only wish that we were where they grow!

295
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:21,013
O stub, I hope my poor mother's drawn my part!

296
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:26,524
Pay e'er this, if not, few coppers will now come to her, for the voyage is up.

297
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:50,166
From the ship's bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive, hammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons mechanically retained in their hands, just as they had darted from their various employments, all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed.

298
00:22:50,146 --> 00:23:03,173
Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's starboard bow till men and timbers reeled.

299
00:23:03,754 --> 00:23:05,458
Some fell flat upon their faces.

300
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,310
Like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooners aloft shook on their bull-like necks.

301
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,175
Through the breach they heard the waters pour as mountain torrents down a flume.

302
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:16,297
The ship!

303
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:17,198
The hearse!

304
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:18,420
The second hearse!

305
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:20,403
cried Ahab from the boat.

306
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,726
Its wood could only be American.

307
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:37,506
Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel, but turning underwater swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab's boat, where for a time he lay quiescent.

308
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:40,150
I turn my body from the sun.

309
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,821
What ho, Tashtego!

310
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:43,162
Let me hear thy hammer!

311
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:43,683
Oh!

312
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:58,076
Ye three unsurrendered spires of mine, Thou uncracked keel, and only god-bullied hull, Thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and pole-pointed prow, Death-glorious ship, must ye then perish, and without me?

313
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:02,760
Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains?

314
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,562
Oh, lonely death on lonely life!

315
00:24:06,263 --> 00:24:10,727
Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief!

316
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:11,067
Ho!

317
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:11,468
ho!

318
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:20,721
from all your furthest bounds, Pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life, And top this one-piled comber of my death.

319
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:29,132
Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale, To the last I grapple with thee, from hell's heart I stab at thee.

320
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:32,597
For hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.

321
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:43,971
Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool, And since neither can be mine, let me then toe to pieces, While still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale.

322
00:24:44,713 --> 00:24:46,418
Thus I give up the spear.

323
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:50,276
The harpoon was darted, the stricken whale flew forward.

324
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:54,461
With igniting velocity, the line ran through the grooves, ran foul.

325
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:56,483
Ahab stooped to clear it.

326
00:24:56,744 --> 00:25:07,377
He did clear it, but the flying turn caught him around the neck, and voicelessly, as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.

327
00:25:07,357 --> 00:25:16,931
Next instant, the heavy ice splice in the rope's final end flew out of the stark empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and, smiting the sea, disappeared in its depths.

328
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:21,457
For an instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still, then turned.

329
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:22,739
The ship?

330
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,483
Great God, where is the ship?

331
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:40,193
Soon they, through dim, bewildering medium, saw her side-long, fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fatima Organa, only the uppermost mass out of water, while fixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches.

332
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:44,822
The pagan harpooneers still maintain their sinking lookouts on the sea.

333
00:25:44,802 --> 00:26:01,242
And now, concentric circle sees the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.

334
00:26:01,222 --> 00:26:19,720
But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost touched,

335
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:29,920
At that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar.

336
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:39,835
A skyhawk that tauntingly had followed the main truck downwards from its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag and incommoding Tash to go there.

337
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:52,807
This bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood, and simultaneously feeling that ethereal thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death gasp, kept his hammer frozen there.

338
00:26:53,348 --> 00:27:08,522
And so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her.

339
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,883
and helmeted herself with it.

340
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:21,796
Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf, a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides, then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.

341
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:23,497
Epilogue.

342
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,560
And I owenly am escaped along to tell thee, Job.

343
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:28,402
The drama's done.

344
00:27:29,103 --> 00:27:31,185
Why then here does any one step forth?

345
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,088
Because one did survive the wreck.

346
00:27:34,372 --> 00:27:52,448
It so chanced that after the Parsees' disappearance I was he whom the fates ordained to take the place of Ahab's bozeman, when that bozeman assumed the vacant post, the same who, when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking-boat, was dropped astern.

347
00:27:52,428 --> 00:28:04,504
So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the half-spent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex.

348
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:16,900
When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool, round and round then, and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve.

349
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:33,619
Till, gaining that vital center, the black bubble upward burst, and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin lifebuoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.

350
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,727
Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirge-like main.

351
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:44,912
The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths.

352
00:28:45,534 --> 00:28:47,998
The savage sea hawks sailed with sheathed beaks.

353
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,047
On the second day, a sail drew nearer, nearer, and picked me up at last.

354
00:28:53,748 --> 00:29:00,100
It was the devious cruising Rachel that, in her retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan.
