00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:10,770
CHAPTER IV THE COUNTERPANE Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.

2
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:13,275
You had almost thought I had been his wife.

3
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:24,435
The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little party-colored squares and triangles, and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure.

4
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:33,951
No two parts of which were of one precise shade owing, I suppose, to his keeping his arm at sea, unmethodically, in sun and shade.

5
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:43,707
His shirt-sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times, this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork.

6
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:50,114
Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt.

7
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:58,964
They so blended their hues together, and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.

8
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:02,147
My sensations were strange.

9
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:03,609
Let me try to explain them.

10
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,875
When I was a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me.

11
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:13,660
Whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.

12
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:16,736
The circumstance was this.

13
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:20,302
I had been cutting up some keep or other way.

14
00:01:20,322 --> 00:01:34,787
I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweet do a few days previous, and my stepmother, who, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless,

15
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:45,979
My mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.

16
00:01:46,820 --> 00:02:01,737
I fell dreadfully, but there was no help for it, so upstairs I went to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible, so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.

17
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:09,196
I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.

18
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:11,822
Sixteen hours in bed!

19
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:18,679
The small of my back ached to think of it, and it was so light too, the sun shining in at the window,

20
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:25,210
and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.

21
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:42,540
I felt worse and worse at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockened feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour.

22
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:54,600
anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time, but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room.

23
00:02:55,801 --> 00:03:05,457
For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.

24
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:18,990
At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze, and slowly waking from it half-steeped in dreams, I opened my eyes, and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness.

25
00:03:19,122 --> 00:03:22,088
Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame.

26
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:25,815
Nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard.

27
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:29,884
But a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.

28
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:38,160
My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent former phantom to which the hand belonged

29
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:55,859
Seemed closely seated by my bedside, for what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand, yet ever thinking that if I could but stir at one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken.

30
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:04,789
I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me, but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all,

31
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:12,239
and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery.

32
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,065
Nay, to this very hour I often puzzle myself with it.

33
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:32,548
Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan arm thrown round me.

34
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:38,640
But at length all the past night's events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality.

35
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:42,507
and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament.

36
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:53,678
For though I tried to move his arm, unlock his bridegroom clasp yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part his twain.

37
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:59,745
I now strove to rouse him, quick aid, but his only answer was snore.

38
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:07,733
I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse collar, and suddenly felt a slight scratch.

39
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:15,355
Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby.

40
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:23,157
A pretty pickle, truly, thought I abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal under tomahawk.

41
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,784
Queequeg, in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!"

42
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:45,229
At length, by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunting as unarmed, and presently he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water,

43
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:56,738
and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike's staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him.

44
00:05:57,578 --> 00:06:18,405
Meanwhile I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature, when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bed-fellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor.

45
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:30,406
And, by certain signs and sounds, gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself.

46
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:35,816
Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture.

47
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:41,085
But the truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy.

48
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:45,931
Say what you will, it is marvellous how essentially polite they are.

49
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:55,142
I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness.

50
00:06:56,484 --> 00:07:05,655
Staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions, for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breathing,

51
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:12,972
Nevertheless, a man like Cui Cui, you don't see every day, he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.

52
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:23,577
He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one, by the by, and then, still minus his trousers, he hunted up his boots.

53
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:48,467
What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush himself boots in hand, and hat on under the bed, when, from sundering violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself, though, by no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his boots.

54
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:55,123
But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage, neither caterpillar nor butterfly.

55
00:07:55,143 --> 00:08:01,718
He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners.

56
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,106
His education was not yet completed.

57
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,770
He was an undergraduate.

58
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:14,345
If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all.

59
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:22,723
But then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on.

60
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:34,284
At last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if not being much accustomed to boots.

61
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:46,045
His pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide wands, probably not made to order, either rather pinched and tormented him at the first go-off of a bitter-cold morning.

62
00:08:46,480 --> 00:09:14,732
Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Cuiquette made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on, I begged him, as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible.

63
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:18,237
He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.

64
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:31,034
At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face, but Kwekweg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.

65
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:42,289
He then donned his waistcoat, and, taking up a piece of hard soap on the washstand's centre-table, dipped it into water, and commenced lathering his face.

66
00:09:42,269 --> 00:10:04,617
I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed-corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, wets it a little on his boot, and, striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning, of his cheeks.

67
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:10,605
Thinks I, quick-quick, this is using Roger's best cutlery with a vengeance.

68
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:22,836
Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation, when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.

69
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:35,327
The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot-monkey jacket, and sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.
