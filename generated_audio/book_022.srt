1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,374
Book the twenty, the killing of the sweeters.

2
00:00:03,935 --> 00:00:08,639
The maids who have misconducted themselves are made to cleans the cloisters and are then hanged.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,746
Then Ulysses tore off his rags and sprang on to the broad pavement with his bow and his quiver full of arrows.

4
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:21,652
He shed the arrows onto the ground at his feet and said, The mighty contest is at an end.

5
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:28,198
I will now see whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark which no man has yet hit.

6
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:35,769
On this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take up a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine, and already had it in his hands.

7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:44,021
He had no thought of death, who amongst all the revelers would think that one man, howe'er the brave, would stand alone among so many and kill him.

8
00:00:44,842 --> 00:00:55,418
The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the point went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup dropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils.

9
00:00:55,398 --> 00:01:02,548
He kicked the table from him and upset the things on it, so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over onto the ground.

10
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:04,918
166f

11
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:08,371
The suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit.

12
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:13,837
They sprang in dismay, one and all of them from their seats, and looked everywhere towards the walls.

13
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:18,342
But there was neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily.

14
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:22,387
Stranger, said they, you shall pay for shooting people in this way.

15
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:24,129
You shall see no other contest.

16
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:25,550
You are a doomed man.

17
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:32,138
He whom you have slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour you for having killed him.

18
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:39,510
Thus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by mistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every one of them.

19
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:44,618
But Ulysses glared at them and said, Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy?

20
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:51,630
You have wasted my substance, thousand one six seven, have forced my women's servants to lie with you, and have wooed my wife while I was still living.

21
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:56,117
You have feared neither God nor man, and now you shall die.

22
00:01:56,097 --> 00:02:03,994
They turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round about to see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone spoke.

23
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:08,042
If you are Ulysses, said he, then what you have said is just.

24
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:11,029
We have done much wrong on your lands and in your house.

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,438
But Antinous who was the head and front of the offending lies low already.

26
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:16,941
It was all his doing.

27
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:19,416
It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope.

28
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:21,138
He did not so much care about that.

29
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,324
What he wanted was something quite different, and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him.

30
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:28,549
He wanted to kill your son and to be chief man in Ithaca.

31
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,558
Now, therefore, that he has met the death which was his due, spare the lives of your people.

32
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:39,289
We will make everything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten and drunk.

33
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,125
Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened.

34
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:51,096
Until we have done this, no one can complain of your being enraged against us.

35
00:02:51,076 --> 00:03:02,177
Ulysses again glared at him and said, though you should give me all that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, I will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full.

36
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:07,667
You must fight or fly for your lives and fly, not a man of you shall.

37
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:13,833
Their hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke, saying, My friends, this man will give us no quarter.

38
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,657
He will stand where he is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us.

39
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:23,022
Let us then show fight, draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows.

40
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:27,146
Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him from the pavement and doorway.

41
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:32,912
We can then get through into the town, and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.

42
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:39,323
As he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides, and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses.

43
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:44,733
But Ulysses instantly shot an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself in his liver.

44
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:48,640
He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table.

45
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:58,098
The cup and all the meats went over onto the ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.

46
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:03,709
Then Amphenomis drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try and get him away from the door.

47
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:07,316
But Telemachus was too quick for him and struck him from behind.

48
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:14,989
The spear caught him between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and struck the earth with his forehead.

49
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:24,887
Then Telemachus sprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that if he stayed to draw it out, someone of the Achaeans might come up and hack at him with his sword,

50
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:29,198
or knock him down, so he set off at a run and immediately was at his father's side.

51
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:35,032
Then he said, Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for your temples.

52
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:42,471
I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armor for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed.

53
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:49,603
Run and fetch them, answered Ulysses, while my arrows hold out, or when I am alone they may get me away from the door.

54
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:54,812
Telemachus did as his father said, and went off to the storeroom where the armor was kept.

55
00:04:55,393 --> 00:05:00,662
He chose four shields, eight spears, and four brass helmets with horsehair plumes.

56
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:09,058
He brought them with all speed to his father and armed himself first, while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armor and took their places near Ulysses.

57
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,693
Meanwhile, Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another.

58
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:24,326
When his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the doorpost and hum a shield four hides thick about his shoulders.

59
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:34,123
On his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of horsehair that nodded menacingly above it, 168, and he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears.

60
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:37,990
Now there was a trap-door 169 on the wall.

61
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:45,100
while at one end of the pavement 170 there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this exit was closed by a well-made door.

62
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:51,408
Ulysses told Philoetius to stand by this door and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a time.

63
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:56,695
But Agelaeus shouted out, cannot someone go up to the trap door and tell the people what is going on?

64
00:05:57,176 --> 00:06:01,902
Help would come at once, and we should soon make an end of this man and his shooting.

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,546
This may not be, Agelaeus, answered Melantheus.

66
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:08,374
The mouth of the narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court.

67
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,380
One brave man could prevent any number from getting in.

68
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:13,024
But I know what I will do.

69
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:19,097
I will bring you arms from the storeroom, for I am sure it is there that Ulysses and his son have put them.

70
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:23,866
On this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the storeroom of Ulysses' house.

71
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:30,920
There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to give them to the suitors.

72
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:37,693
Ulysses' heart began to fail him when he saw the suitors 171 putting on their armor and brandishing their spears.

73
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:45,305
He saw the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, Some one of the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be Melantheus.

74
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:49,792
Telemachus answered, The fault, father, is mine, and mine only.

75
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:53,738
I left the storeroom door open, and they have kept a sharper lookout than I have.

76
00:06:54,318 --> 00:07:02,551
Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melantheus the son of Doleus.

77
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,115
Thus did they converse.

78
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:19,797
Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the storeroom to fetch more armor, but the swineherd saw him and said to Ulysses who was beside him, Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to the storeroom.

79
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:29,432
Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him, or shall I bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many wrongs that he has done in your house?

80
00:07:29,412 --> 00:07:34,243
Ulysses answered, Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check no matter what they do.

81
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:38,293
Go back both of you and bind Melanthius's hands and feet behind him.

82
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:41,500
Throw him into the storeroom and make the door fast behind you.

83
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:47,033
Then fasten a noose about his body and string him close up to the rafters from a high bearing post

84
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:50,200
thousand five and two, that he may linger on in an agony."

85
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,087
Thus did he speak, and they did.

86
00:07:53,127 --> 00:08:05,595
Even as he had said, they went to the storeroom, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, so the two took their stand on either side of the door and waited.

87
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:17,455
By and by Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand and an old dry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the straps had become unsewn.

88
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:23,567
On this the two seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and threw him struggling to the ground.

89
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:30,080
They bent his hands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses had told them.

90
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,270
Then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him up from a high pillar till he was close up to the rafters.

91
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:43,446
And over him did you then vaunt, O swineherd Eumaeus saying, Melantheus, you will pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve.

92
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:50,434
You will know very well when morning comes from the streams of Oceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast on."

93
00:08:51,135 --> 00:09:02,388
There then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on their armor, they closed the door behind them and went back to take their places by the side of Ulysses, whereon the four men stood in the cloister, fierce and full of fury.

94
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:06,894
Nevertheless, those who were in the body of the court were still both brave and many.

95
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:12,420
Then Jove's daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form of mentor.

96
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:19,774
Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, Mentor, lend me your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns he has done you.

97
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:21,718
Besides, you are my age, mate.

98
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,810
But all the time he felt sure was Minerva, and the suitors from the other side raised an uproar when they saw her.

99
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,232
Agelaeus was the first to reproach her.

100
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:35,938
Mentor, he cried, do not let Ulysses beguile you into siding with him and fighting the suitors.

101
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,420
This is what we will do.

102
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,183
When we have killed these people, father and son, we will kill you too.

103
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:50,593
You shall pay for it with your head, and when we have killed you, we will take all you have, indoors or out, and bring it into hodgepodge with Ulysses' property.

104
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:57,780
We will not let your sons live in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue to live in the city of Ithaca.

105
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,789
This made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very angrily to 173.

106
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:12,086
"'Ulysses,' said she, "'your strength and prowess are no longer what they were when you fought for nine long years among the Trojans about the noble lady Helen.

107
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:18,317
You killed many a man in those days, and it was through your stratagem that Priam's city was taken,

108
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:24,966
How comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house?

109
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:33,158
Come on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alchemus, shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him."

110
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:46,296
But she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in the form of a swallow.

111
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:55,986
Meanwhile, Agelaeus' son of Damastor, Uranimus, Amphimidon, Demoptolemus, Pisander, and Polybus, son of Polyctor, bore the brunt of the fight upon the suitor's side.

112
00:10:56,426 --> 00:11:03,313
Of all those who were still fighting for their lives, they were by far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen under the arrows of Ulysses.

113
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:11,862
Agelaeus shouted to them and said, My friends, he will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag.

114
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:13,807
they are standing at the doors unsupported.

115
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:20,964
Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw your spears first and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by killing him.

116
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:24,533
When he has fallen, we need not be uneasy about the others."

117
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:27,420
They threw their spears as he bade them,

118
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,583
but Minerva made them all of no effect.

119
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:48,092
One hit the doorpost, another went against the door, the pointed shaft of another struck the wall, and as soon as they had avoided all the spears of the suitors, Ulysses said to his own men, My friends, I should say, we too had better let drive into the middle of them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us by killing us outright.

120
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:50,978
They therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.

121
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,014
Ulysses killed Demoptilemus, Telemachus Eurydes, Eumaeus Elatus, while the stockmen killed Pisander.

122
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:07,515
These all bit the dust, and as the others drew back into a corner, Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.

123
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:12,704
The suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their weapons for the most part without effect.

124
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:19,396
One hit a bearing post of the cloister, another went against the door, while the pointed shaft of another struck the wall.

125
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:31,157
Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from off Telemachus' wrist, and Cetesippus managed to graze Eumaeus' shoulder above his shield, but the spear went on and fell to the ground.

126
00:12:31,137 --> 00:12:34,260
Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd of suitors.

127
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:39,125
Ulysses hit Eurydemus, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus Polybus.

128
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:52,917
After this the stockman hit Tesipus in the breast and taunted him, saying, Foul-mouthed son of Polytherces, do not be so foolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your speech, for the gods are far stronger than men.

129
00:12:53,538 --> 00:13:00,925
I make you a present of this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when he was begging about in his own house.

130
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:14,061
Thus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with the spear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor in the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell forward full on his face upon the ground.

131
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:20,169
Then Minerva from her seat on the rafter held up her deadly Aegis, and the hearts of the suitors quailed.

132
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:26,777
They fled to the other end of the cord like a herd of cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their longest.

133
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:38,298
As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground and kill them, for they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on enjoy the sport.

134
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,568
Even so did Ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite them on every side.

135
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:48,571
They made a horrible groaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood.

136
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:55,762
Laodice then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, Ulysses the first did beseech you have mercy upon me and spare me.

137
00:13:56,183 --> 00:14:01,211
I never wronged any of the women in your house, either in word or deed, and I tried to stop the others.

138
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,438
I saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for their folly.

139
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,421
I was their sacrificing priest.

140
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:13,949
If you kill me, I shall die without having done anything to deserve it, and shall have got no thanks for all the good that I did."

141
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:25,424
Ulysses looked sternly at him and answered, "'If you were their sacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be long before I got home again, and that you might marry my wife and have children by her.

142
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:27,527
Therefore you shall die.'"

143
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:33,533
With these words he picked up the sword that Agelaeus had dropped when he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground.

144
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:39,520
Then he struck Laodice on the back of his neck so that his head fell rolling in the dust while he was yet speaking.

145
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:46,127
The minstrel Femius son of Terpes, he who had been forced by the suitors to sing to them, now tried to save his life.

146
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:52,013
He was standing near towards the trapdoor, wad 74, and held his lyre in his hand.

147
00:14:51,993 --> 00:15:09,597
He did not know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to go straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he deemed it best to embrace Ulysses' knees.

148
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:15,906
So he laid his lyre on the ground between the mixing bowl, one T5 and the silver studded seat, then going up to Ulysses.

149
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:21,073
He caught hold of his knees and said, Ulysses, I beseech you have mercy on me and spare me.

150
00:15:21,393 --> 00:15:25,920
You will be sorry for it afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both the gods and men as I can.

151
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,247
I make all my lays myself, and heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration.

152
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:33,416
I would sing to you as though you were a god.

153
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:36,380
Do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off.

154
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:46,217
Your own son Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent your house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were too many and too strong for me, so they made me.

155
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:49,843
Telemachus heard him and at once went up to his father.

156
00:15:49,823 --> 00:16:03,916
Hold, he cried, the man is guiltless, do him no hurt, and we will spare Medon too, who was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or Eumaeus has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you were raging about the court.

157
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:17,569
Medon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly flayed heifer's hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus, and laid hold of his knees,

158
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:19,432
"'Here I am, my dear sir,' said he.

159
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:28,405
"'Stay your hand, therefore, and tell your father, "'or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors "'for having wasted his substance "'and been so foolishly disrespectful to yourself.'

160
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:38,559
"'Ulysses smiled at him and answered, "'Fear not, Telemachus has saved your life "'that you may know in future, "'and tell other people how greatly better "'good deeds prosper than evil ones.

161
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:47,472
"'Go, therefore, outside the cloisters "'into the outer court, "'and be out of the way of the slaughter, "'you and the bard, while I finish my work here inside.'

162
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:56,366
The pair went into the outer court as fast as they could and sat down by Jove's great altar, looking fearfully round and still expecting that they would be killed.

163
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:06,479
Then Ulysses searched the whole court carefully over to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living, but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their blood.

164
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:14,809
They were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the heat of the sun makes an end of them.

165
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:18,392
Even so were the suitors lying all huddled up one against the other.

166
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:23,781
Then Ulysses said to Telemachus, Call nurse Eurycleia, I have something to say to her.

167
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,805
Telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room.

168
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:31,472
Make haste, said he, you old woman who have been set over all the other women in the house.

169
00:17:31,993 --> 00:17:34,637
Come outside, my father wishes to speak to you.

170
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:39,848
When Eurycleia heard this, she unfastened the door of the women's room and came out following Telemachus.

171
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:55,039
She found Ulysses among the corpses bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so that he is a fearful sight, even so was Ulysses besmirched from head to foot with gore.

172
00:17:55,019 --> 00:18:02,192
When she saw all the corpses in such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw that a great deed had been done.

173
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:05,238
But Ulysses checked her, old woman, said he.

174
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:09,366
Rejoice in silence, restrain yourself, and do not make any noise about it.

175
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:12,792
It is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men.

176
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:25,785
Heaven's doom and their own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction, for they respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for their wickedness and folly.

177
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:31,123
Now, however, tell me which of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, and who are innocent.

178
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:32,526
176.

179
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:35,792
I will tell you the truth, my son, answered Eurycleia.

180
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:41,863
There are fifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding wool, and all kinds of household work.

181
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:48,516
Of these, twelve in Allen 77 have misbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope.

182
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:55,611
They showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only lately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders to the female servants.

183
00:18:55,972 --> 00:19:00,962
But let me go upstairs and tell your wife all that has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.

184
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:08,057
Do not wake her yet, answered Ulysses, but tell the women who have misconducted themselves to come to me.

185
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:11,581
Eurycleia left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come to Ulysses.

186
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:16,907
In the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the swineherd, the stockman, and the swineherd.

187
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:20,791
Begin, said he, to remove the dead, and make the women help you.

188
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:25,096
Then get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables and seats.

189
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:35,547
When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters, take the women into the space between the domed room and the wall of the outer court, and run them through with your swords till they are quite dead,

190
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:40,294
and have forgotten all about love and the way in which they used to lie in secret with the suitors.

191
00:19:41,455 --> 00:19:44,980
On this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.

192
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:49,747
First they carried the dead bodies out and propped them up against one another in the gatehouse.

193
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:55,115
Ulysses ordered them about and made them do their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out.

194
00:19:55,796 --> 00:20:03,947
When they had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and water, while Telemachus and the two others shoveled up the blood and dirt from the ground

195
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:06,650
and the women carried it all the way and put it out of doors.

196
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:25,513
Then when they had made the whole place quite clean and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space between the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so that they could not get away, and Telemachus said to the other two, I shall not let these women die a clean death, for they were insolent to me and my mother, and used to sleep with the suitors.

197
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:43,215
So saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the building, at a good height lest any of the women's feet should touch the ground, and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set for them in a thicket, just as they were getting to their nest, and a terrible fate awaits them.

198
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:47,200
Even so did the women have to put their heads in nooses one after the other and diamond.

199
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,624
As for Melantheus, they took him through the cloister into the inner court.

200
00:20:51,305 --> 00:20:59,154
There they cut off his nose and his ears, they drew out his vitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his feet.

201
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:04,520
When they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back into the house, for all was now over.

202
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:07,684
And Ulysses said to the dear old nurse Eurycleia,

203
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:14,383
Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and fetch fire also that I may burn it and purify the cloisters.

204
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:20,678
Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants, and also all the maidservants that are in the house."

205
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,783
"'All that you have said is true,' answered Eurycleia.

206
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:27,028
"'But let me bring you some clean clothes, a shirt and cloak.

207
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:29,071
Do not keep these rags on your back any longer.

208
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:30,113
It is not right.'

209
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,957
"'First light me a fire,' replied Ulysses."

210
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:41,130
She brought the fire and sulphur as he had bidden her, and Ulysses thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts.

211
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:52,323
Then she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened, whereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands, and pressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing his head and shoulders and taking hold of his hands.

212
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:58,461
It made him feel as if he should like to weep, for he remembered every one of them, 179.
