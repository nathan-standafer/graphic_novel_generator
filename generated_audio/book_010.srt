00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,101
Book X Aeolus, The Lestrigons CICIC.

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:10,957
Thence we went on to the Aeolian island where lives Aeolus son of Hippitas, dear to the immortal gods.

3
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:17,854
It is an island that floats, as it were, upon the sea eighty-three iron bound with a wall that girds it.

4
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:21,018
Now Aeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons.

5
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:29,049
So he made the sons marry the daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother, feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury.

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:40,364
All day long the atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats till it groans again, yard and all, but by night they sleep on their well-made bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets.

7
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:43,808
These were the people among whom we had now come,

8
00:00:43,788 --> 00:00:50,841
Aeolus entertained me for a whole month, asking me questions all the time about Troy, the ArgaÃ¯ fleet, and the return of the Achaeans.

9
00:00:51,622 --> 00:01:00,459
I told him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must go, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of difficulty, but set about doing so at once.

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,652
Moreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up in the hide as in a sack,

11
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:13,821
for Jove had made him captain over the winds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his own pleasure.

12
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:21,553
He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side wind could blow from any quarter.

13
00:01:22,294 --> 00:01:26,219
The west wind, which was fair for us, did he alone let blow as it chose.

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,125
But it all came to nothing, for we were lost through our own folly.

15
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:36,795
Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native land showed on the horizon.

16
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:48,152
We got so close in that we could see the stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell into a light sleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands that we might get home the faster.

17
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:54,807
On this the men fell to talking among themselves and said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus had given me.

18
00:01:55,388 --> 00:02:02,621
Bless my heart, would one turn to his neighbor saying, how this man gets honored and makes friends to whatever city or country he may go.

19
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:11,777
See what fine prizes he is taking home from Troy, while we, who have traveled just as far as he has, come back with hands as empty as we set out with.

20
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:14,557
and now Aeolus has given him ever so much more.

21
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:20,109
Quick, let us see what it all is, and how much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave him.

22
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:23,516
Thus they talked, and evil counsels prevailed.

23
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:32,314
They loosed the sack, whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried us weeping out to sea and away from our own country.

24
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:46,098
Then I awoke, and knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the best of it, but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back to the Aeolian island.

25
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:52,108
When we reached it, we went ashore to take in water, and dined hard by the ships.

26
00:02:52,088 --> 00:03:02,334
Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of my men and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting with his wife and family, so we sat down as suppliants on the threshold.

27
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:07,126
They were astounded when they saw us and said, Ulysses, what brings you here?

28
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,692
What God has been ill-treating you?

29
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:14,980
We took great pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever it was that you wanted to go to."

30
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:22,210
Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, My men have undone me, they and cruel sleep have ruined me.

31
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:27,478
My friends, mend me this mischief, for you can if you will.

32
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:34,955
I spoke as movingly as I could but they said nothing till their father answered, vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the island.

33
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,561
Him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help.

34
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:41,350
Be off, for you come here as one abhorred of heaven.

35
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:44,049
and with these words he sent me sorrowing from his door.

36
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:51,020
Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them.

37
00:03:51,561 --> 00:04:08,367
Six days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the rocky stronghold of Lamus Telepolis, the city of the Lestragonians, where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats to be milked, salutes him who is driving out his flock to feed, and this last answers the salute.

38
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:18,681
In that country a man who could do without sleep might earn double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle and another as a shepherd, for they work much the same by night as they do by day for.

39
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:25,451
When we reached the harbour we found it landlocked under steep cliffs with a narrow entrance between two headlands.

40
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:34,523
My captains took all their ships inside and made them fast close to one another, for there was never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead calm.

41
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:38,469
I kept my own ship outside and moored it to a rock at the very end of the point.

42
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:45,397
Then I climbed a high rock to reconnoiter, but could see no sign neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from the ground.

43
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:50,644
So I sent two of my company with an attendant to find out what sort of people the inhabitants were.

44
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:57,372
The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the people draw their firewood from the mountains into the town.

45
00:04:57,554 --> 00:05:04,343
till presently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water, and who was daughter to a Lestrigonian named Antiphetes.

46
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,928
She was going to the fountain, Artatia, from which the people bring in their water.

47
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:18,981
And when my men had come close up to her, they asked her who the king of that country might be, and over what kind of people he ruled, so she directed them to her father's house.

48
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:26,110
But when they got there they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they were horrified at the sight of her.

49
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:32,607
She had once called her husband Antiphetes from the place of assembly, and forthwith he set about killing my men.

50
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:40,212
snatched up one of them and began to make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could.

51
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:48,502
But Antiphetes raised a hue and cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Lastergonians sprang up from every quarter ogres, not men.

52
00:05:49,143 --> 00:06:02,678
They threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs, as though they had been mere stones, and I heard the horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the death cries of my men, as the Lastergonians speared them like fishes and took them home to eat them.

53
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:12,158
While they were thus killing my men within the harbour, I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and told my men to row with all their might, if they too would not fare like the rest.

54
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:18,611
So they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful enough when we got into open water, out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us.

55
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,477
As for the others, there was not one of them left.

56
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:28,787
Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we had lost our comrades, and came to the Aean island, where Circe lives.

57
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:37,098
A great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician Aetes, for they are both children of the sun by purse, who is daughter to Oceanus.

58
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:46,671
We brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word, for some god guided us thither, and having landed we lay there for two days and two nights, worn out in body and mind.

59
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:56,620
When the morning of the third day came, I took my spear and my sword and went away from the ship to Reconnoitre and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork or hear the sound of voices.

60
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:09,835
Climbing to the top of a high lookout, I espied the smoke of Circe's house rising upwards amid a dense forest of trees, and when I saw this, I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more.

61
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:17,164
But in the end, I deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself.

62
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:24,378
When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my solitude and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my path.

63
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:32,233
He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the river, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck him in the middle of the back.

64
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:37,961
The bronze point of the spear went clean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of him.

65
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:42,667
Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and laid it down.

66
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:51,740
I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet of the noble creature together.

67
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:56,787
Having so done, I hung him round my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear.

68
00:07:57,155 --> 00:08:02,322
the stag was much too big for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder, steadying him with one hand.

69
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:07,990
As I threw him down in front of the ship I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them.

70
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,253
"'Look here, my friends,' said I.

71
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:17,704
"'We are not going to die so much before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starve so long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.'

72
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:23,752
On this they uncovered their heads upon the seashore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a splendid fellow.

73
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,077
Then, when they had feasted their eyes upon him sufficiently,

74
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:29,499
they washed their hands and began to cook him for dinner.

75
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:39,249
Thus through the live long day to the going down of the sun we stayed there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped upon the seashore.

76
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:46,997
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, My friends, we are in very great difficulties.

77
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:48,359
Listen, therefore, to me.

78
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:54,685
We have no idea where the sun either sets or rises eighty-five, so that we do not even know east from west.

79
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:56,322
I see no way out of it, nevertheless.

80
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:57,857
We must try and find one."

81
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:04,317
We are certainly on an island, for I went as high as I could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to the horizon.

82
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:09,443
It lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out of a thick forest of trees.

83
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:17,152
Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates and by the savage ogre Polyphemus.

84
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:25,482
They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a captain over each.

85
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:29,326
I gave one company to Eurylochus, while I took command of the other myself.

86
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:38,114
Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon Eurylochus, so he set out with his twenty-two men, and they wept, as also did we who were left behind.

87
00:09:38,714 --> 00:09:45,040
When they reached Circe's house they found it built of cut stones, on a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest.

88
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:53,848
There were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it, poor bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged into subjection.

89
00:09:53,828 --> 00:10:00,281
They did not attack my men, but wagged their great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them.

90
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:06,674
Eighty-six, as hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming from dinner, for they know he will bring them something.

91
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:11,263
Even so did these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men.

92
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,550
but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.

93
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:28,341
Presently they reached the gates of the goddess's house, and as they stood there they could hear Cersei within, singing most beautifully as she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling colors as no one but a goddess could weave.

94
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:36,534
On this Polites, whom I valued and trusted more than any other of my men, said, There is someone inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully.

95
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:38,136
The whole place resounds with it.

96
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:41,121
Let us call her and see whether she is woman or goddess.

97
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,708
They called her, and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them enter.

98
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:52,438
They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who suspected mischief and stayed outside.

99
00:10:52,418 --> 00:11:08,921
When she had got them into her house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked poisons to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand and shut them up in her pigsties.

100
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:17,734
They were like pig's head, hair, and all, and they grunted just as pigs do, but their senses were the same as before, and they remembered everything.

101
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:27,876
Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Cersei threw them some acorns and beech-masts, such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to tell me about the sad fate of our comrades.

102
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:41,429
He was so overcome with dismay, that though he tried to speak he could find no words to do so, his eyes filled with tears, and he could only sob and sigh, till at last we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had happened to the others.

103
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:50,860
We went, said he, as you told us, through the forest, and in the middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place that could be seen from far.

104
00:11:50,840 --> 00:12:01,477
There we found a woman, or else she was a goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly, so the men shouted to her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door, and invited us in.

105
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:08,929
The others did not suspect any mischief, so they followed her into the house, but I stayed where I was, for I thought there might be some treachery.

106
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,480
From that moment I saw them no more, for not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching for them.

107
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:18,661
Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders.

108
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:23,208
I also took my bow and told Eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the way.

109
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:35,146
But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously, saying, Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me stay here, for I know you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even return alive yourself.

110
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:41,535
Let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we may still save our lives.

111
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:44,960
Stay where you are then, answered I, eating and drinking at the ship.

112
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,144
But I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.

113
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:50,808
With this I left the ship and went up inland.

114
00:12:51,249 --> 00:13:02,945
When I got through the charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe, I met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the heyday of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his face.

115
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:08,012
He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, My poor unhappy man,

116
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:11,757
Whither are you going over this mountaintop, alone and without knowing the way?

117
00:13:12,578 --> 00:13:17,045
Your men are shut up in Circe's pigsties, like so many wild boars in their lairs.

118
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:19,889
You surely do not fancy that you can set them free?

119
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:23,994
I can tell you that you will never get back and will have to stay there with the rest of them.

120
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:27,599
But never mind, I will protect you and get you out of your difficulty.

121
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,287
Take this herb, which is one of great virtue, and keep it about you when you go to Circe's house.

122
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:37,493
It will be a talisman to you against every kind of mischief.

123
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:41,923
And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Cersei will try to practice upon you.

124
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:52,187
She will mix a mess for you to drink, and she will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to charm you, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent her spells from working.

125
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:54,132
I will tell you all about it.

126
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:59,993
When Cersei strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as though you were going to kill her.

127
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:03,517
She will then be frightened, and will desire you to go to bed with her.

128
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:10,226
On this you must not point-blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions free, and to take good care also of yourself.

129
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:20,338
But you must make her swear solemnly by all the blessed gods that she will plot no further mischief against you, or else when she has got you naked, she will unman you and make you fit for nothing.

130
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:24,005
As he spoke, he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it was like.

131
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:27,412
The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk.

132
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:32,743
The gods call it moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do whatever they like.

133
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:37,112
Then Mercury went back to High Olympus, passing over the wooded island.

134
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:42,461
but I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with care as I walked along.

135
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:50,730
When I got to the gates I stood there and called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door, and asked me to come in, so I followed her.

136
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:52,372
Much troubled in my mind.

137
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:56,296
She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver.

138
00:14:56,596 --> 00:15:04,905
There was a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed a mess in a golden goblet for me to drink, but she drugged it, for she meant me mischief.

139
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,766
When she had given it me, and I had drunk it without its charming me, she struck me with her wand.

140
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:14,593
There now, she cried, be off to the pigsty, and make your lair with the rest of them.

141
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:25,688
But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her, whereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke piteously, saying, Who and whence are you?

142
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,690
From what place and people have you come?

143
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:31,315
How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?

144
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:35,942
Never yet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I gave you.

145
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:37,505
You must be spell-proof.

146
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:46,118
Surely you can be none other than the bold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always said would come here some day with his ship while on his way home from Troy.

147
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,099
So be it then.

148
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,987
Sheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends and learn to trust each other.

149
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:58,537
And I answered, Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with you when you have just been turning all my men into pigs?

150
00:15:59,118 --> 00:16:06,209
And now that you have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing.

151
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:13,239
I shall certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will first take your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.

152
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,868
So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed her oath, then I went to bed with her.

153
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:22,817
Meanwhile, her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about their work.

154
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:28,241
They are the children of the groves and fountains and of the holy waters that run down into the sea.

155
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,126
One of them spread a fair purple cloth over a seat and laid a carpet underneath it.

156
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,950
Another brought tables of silver up to the seats and set them with baskets of gold.

157
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:49,902
A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth brought in water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted.

158
00:16:49,882 --> 00:17:02,193
When the water in the cauldron was boiling eighty-seven, she poured cold into it till it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders to take the tire and stiffness out of my limbs.

159
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,983
As soon as she had done washing me and anointing me with oil,

160
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:11,412
She arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver.

161
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:13,815
There was a footstool also under my feet.

162
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:23,230
A maidservant then brought me water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me.

163
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:33,821
An upper servant brought me bread and offered me many things of what there was in the house, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without heeding what was before me, still moody and suspicious.

164
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:46,075
When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief, she came to me and said, Ulysses, why do you sit like that as though you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and drink?

165
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,237
Is it that you are still suspicious?

166
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:53,082
You ought not to be, for I have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.

167
00:17:53,062 --> 00:18:01,902
And I said, Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can think of either eating or drinking in your house until you have set his friends free and let him see them.

168
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:09,298
If you want me to eat and drink, you must free my men and bring them to me, that I may see them with my own eyes.

169
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:14,838
When I had said this, she went straight through the court with her wand in her hand and opened the pigsty doors.

170
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:18,682
My men came out like so many prime hogs, and stood looking at her.

171
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:22,366
But she went about among them, and anointed each with a second drug.

172
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:30,694
Whereon the bristles that the bad drug had given them fell off, and they became men again, younger than they were before, and much taller and better looking.

173
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:38,222
They knew me at once, seized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the whole house was filled with the sound of their halloa bellowing.

174
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:48,854
and Circe herself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and said, Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, go back at once to the sea where you have left your ship and first draw it on to the land.

175
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:54,100
Then, hide all your ship's gear and property in some cave and come back here with your men.

176
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:01,088
I agreed to this, so I went back to the seashore and found the men at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously.

177
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:12,147
When they saw me the silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out and gamble round their mothers, when they see them coming home to be milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead resounds with their lowing.

178
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:18,015
They seemed as glad to see me as though they had got back to their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born and bred.

179
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:26,907
Sir, said the affectionate creatures, we are as glad to see you back as though we had got safe home to Ithaca, but tell us all about the fate of our comrades.

180
00:19:26,954 --> 00:19:41,064
I spoke comfortingly to them and said, We must draw our ship onto the land and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some cave, then come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe's house, where you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great abundance.

181
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:45,975
On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried to hold them back and said,

182
00:19:45,955 --> 00:19:47,899
Alas, poor wretches that we are!

183
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:49,161
What will become of us?

184
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:58,238
Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe, who will turn us all into pigs, or wolves, or lions, and we shall have to keep guard over her house.

185
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:04,009
Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them.

186
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:08,638
It was all through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.

187
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:17,693
When I heard him, I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of his being in near relation of my own.

188
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:26,385
But the men interceded for him and said, Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and mine the ship, but take the rest of us with you to Cersei's house.

189
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:35,638
On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand that I had given him.

190
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:41,034
Meanwhile, Cersei had been seeing that the men who had been left behind were washed and anointed with olive oil.

191
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:47,974
She had also given them woolen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all comfortably at dinner in her house.

192
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:55,171
As soon as the men saw each other face to face and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole palace rang again.

193
00:20:55,952 --> 00:21:02,298
Thereon Circe came up to me and said, Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men to leave off crying.

194
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:08,665
I know how much you have, all of you, suffered at sea and how ill you have fared among cruel savages on the mainland.

195
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:15,733
But that is over now, so stay here and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and hearty as you were when you left Ithaca.

196
00:21:15,713 --> 00:21:18,519
for at present you are weakened both in body and mind.

197
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,893
You keep all the time thinking of the hardships you have suffered during your travels, so that you have no more cheerfulness left in you."

198
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:27,498
Thus did she speak, and we assented.

199
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,992
We stayed with Circe for a whole twelve months, feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine.

200
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:46,626
But when the year had passed and the waning of moons, and the long days had come round, my men called me apart and said, Sir, it is time you began to think about going home, if so be you are to be spared to see your house and native country at all.

201
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,534
Thus did they speak, and I assented.

202
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:54,761
Thereon, through the livelong day, to the going down of the sun, we feasted our fill on meat and wine.

203
00:21:55,282 --> 00:22:00,429
But when the sun went down and it came on dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep in the covered cloisters.

204
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:07,999
I, however, after I had got into bed with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened to what I had got to say.

205
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,408
Circe, said I, pleased to keep the promise you made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage.

206
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,862
I want to get back, and so do my men.

207
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:21,328
They are always pestering me with their complaints as soon as ever your back is turned.'

208
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:32,064
And the goddess answered, Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall none of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there is another journey which you have got to take before you can sail homewards.

209
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:42,218
You must go to the house of Hades, and of dread Proserpine, to consult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teresias, whose reason is still unshaken.

210
00:22:42,198 --> 00:22:48,028
To him alone has Proserpine left his understanding even in death, but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.

211
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:50,252
I was dismayed when I heard this.

212
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:55,140
I sat up in bed and wept, and would gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun.

213
00:22:55,801 --> 00:23:01,511
But presently, when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, And who shall guide me upon this voyage?

214
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:05,337
For the house of Hades is a port that no ship can reach.

215
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,200
"'You will want no guide,' she answered.

216
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,049
"'Raise your mast, set your white sails, sit quite still, and the north wind will blow you there of itself.

217
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:23,084
When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will reach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country, with its groves of tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely.

218
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:28,793
Here beach your ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark abode of Hades.'"

219
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:41,192
You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphligethon and Kositis, which is a branch of the river Styx, flow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers run into one another.

220
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:57,177
When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a drink offering to all the dead, first honey mixed with milk, then wine, and in the third place, water sprinkling white barley meal over the whole.

221
00:23:57,157 --> 00:24:08,093
Moreover, you must offer many prayers to the poor, feeble ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca, you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load the pyre with good things.

222
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:15,504
More particularly, you must promise that Teresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all your flocks.

223
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:26,640
When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus, but yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the river.

224
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:37,376
On this, many dead men's ghosts will come to you, and you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have just killed, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to Proserpine.

225
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:45,108
Then draw your sword and sit there, so as to prevent any other poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Tirias shall have answered your questions.

226
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:54,282
The seer will presently come to you, and will tell you about your voyage, what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home.

227
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:59,212
It was daybreak by the time she had done speaking, so she dressed me in my shirt and cloak.

228
00:24:59,753 --> 00:25:08,771
As for herself, she threw a beautiful light gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle round her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle.

229
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:15,645
Then I went about among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to each of them man by man.

230
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:18,606
You must not lie sleeping here any longer," said I to them.

231
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:23,795
We must be going, for Circe has told me all about it, and on this they did as I bade them.

232
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:27,721
Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure.

233
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:38,899
We had with us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the housetop away from the rest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool.

234
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:49,994
When he heard the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so he tumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul went down to the house of Hades.

235
00:25:50,535 --> 00:26:03,773
When I have got the men together I said to them, You think you are about to start home again, but Circe has explained to me that instead of this, we have got to go to the house of Hades in Proserpine to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Tiresias.

236
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:10,905
The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves on the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend matters by crying.

237
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:19,280
When we reached the seashore, weeping and lamenting our fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard by the ship.

238
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:26,993
She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it, for who can see the comings and goings of a god if the god does not wish to be seen?
