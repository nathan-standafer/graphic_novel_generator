00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,911
Chapter 133 - The Chase-First Day.

2
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:22,972
That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man, as his want at intervals, stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle.

3
00:00:23,793 --> 00:00:25,716
He declared that a whale must be near.

4
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:33,885
Soon that peculiar odour, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm-whale, was palpable to all the watch.

5
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:47,739
Nor was any mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vein, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odour as nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:01:00,733
The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea, directly in length lies ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it.

7
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:06,340
the polished, metallic-like marks of some swift tide rip at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.

8
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:08,342
Man the mast, heads!

9
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:09,544
Call all hands!

10
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:22,520
Thundering with the butts of three clubbed hand spikes on the forecastle deck, Dagu roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands.

11
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:23,961
What do you see?

12
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:27,025
cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.

13
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:30,230
"'Nothing, nothing, sir,' was the sound hailing down in reply.

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,432
"'To gallant sails!

15
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:32,393
Stun sails!

16
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,717
Allow and aloft and on both sides!'

17
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:57,028
All sail being set, he now cast loose the lifeline, reserve for swaying him to the main royal mast head, and in a few moments they were hoisting him fither, when, while but two-thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main top sail and top gallant sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the air.

18
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:58,350
There she blows!

19
00:01:58,731 --> 00:01:59,733
There she blows!

20
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:01,596
A hump like a snow hill!

21
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:02,898
It is Moby Dick!"

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:13,616
Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three lookouts, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing.

23
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:22,712
Ahab had now gained his final perch some feet above the other lookouts, Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant mast.

24
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:26,215
so that the Indian's head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.

25
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:37,446
From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high, sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air.

26
00:02:38,307 --> 00:02:45,534
To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian oceans.

27
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:48,597
And did none of ye see it before?

28
00:02:48,997 --> 00:02:51,940
cried Ahab, hailing the perched man all around him.

29
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:58,454
I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I cried out," said Tashtego.

30
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:00,636
Not the same instant, not the same.

31
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:02,257
No, the doubloon is mine.

32
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:04,119
Fate reserved the doubloon for me.

33
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,683
I only, none of ye could have raised the white whale first.

34
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:18,433
There she blows, there she blows, there she blows, there she blows, there again, there again, he cried in long-drawn, lingering, methodic tones.

35
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,976
attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale's visible jets.

36
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:23,640
He's going to sound!

37
00:03:24,443 --> 00:03:29,035
In stun sails, down top gallant sails, stand by three boats.

38
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,524
Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board and keep the ship.

39
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,971
Helm there, luff, luff a point.

40
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:36,793
So, steady, man, steady.

41
00:03:37,294 --> 00:03:38,075
There go flukes.

42
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,017
No, no, only black water.

43
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:41,418
Already the boat's there.

44
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,020
Already the boat's there.

45
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,722
Stand by, stand by.

46
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:46,584
Lower me, Mr. Starbuck.

47
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:48,226
Lower, lower, quick, quicker.

48
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:50,409
And he slid through the air to the deck.

49
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,873
He is heading straight to leeward, sir, cried Stubb.

50
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,214
Right away from us.

51
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,936
Cannot have seen the ship yet.

52
00:03:57,717 --> 00:03:58,478
Be dumb, man.

53
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,679
Stand by the braces.

54
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,781
Hard down the helm.

55
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:01,482
Brace up.

56
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:04,485
Shiver her, shiver her, shiver her.

57
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:05,486
So, well that!

58
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:06,648
Boats, boats!"

59
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:18,084
Soon all the boats but Starbucks were dropped, all the boat sails set, all the paddles plying, with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward, and Ahab heading the onset.

60
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:24,133
A pale death-glimmer lit up Fidala's sunken eyes, a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.

61
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:31,063
Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prowls sped through the sea, but only slowly they neared the foe.

62
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:39,796
As they neared him the ocean grew still more smooth, seemed drawing a carpet over its waves, seemed a noon meadow so serenely it spread.

63
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:49,018
At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible.

64
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:56,569
sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam.

65
00:04:56,609 --> 00:05:01,316
He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond.

66
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:17,200
Before it, far out on the soft, Turkish rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade, and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake.

67
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,906
and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side.

68
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:37,011
But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight, and like to some flagstaff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back,

69
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:48,568
and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.

70
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:56,704
A gentle joyousness, a mighty mildness of repose and swiftness, invested the gliding whale.

71
00:05:56,684 --> 00:06:11,485
Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns, his lovely, leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid, with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete.

72
00:06:11,926 --> 00:06:15,351
Not Jove, not that great majesty supreme.

73
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:19,597
did surpass the glorified white whale as he so divinely swam.

74
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:27,348
On each soft side, coincident with the parted swell, that but once leaving him, then flowed so wide away.

75
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,973
On each bright side, the whale shed off enticings.

76
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:42,469
No wonder there had been some, among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured to assail it, but had fatally found that quietude,

77
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:43,972
but the vesture of tornadoes.

78
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:57,657
Yet calm, enticing calm, O whale, thou glidest on, to all who for the first time ivy, no matter how many in that same way thou mayest have bejuggled and destroyed before.

79
00:06:58,615 --> 00:07:15,249
And thus, through the serene tranquilities of the tropical sea, among waves whose hand clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.

80
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,678
But soon the forepart of him slowly rose from the water.

81
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:32,403
For an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia's natural bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the Grand God revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.

82
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:39,878
Hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.

83
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:49,028
With oars a-peak and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's reappearance.

84
00:07:50,050 --> 00:08:00,752
An hour, said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern, and he gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward.

85
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:06,810
It was only an instant, for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.

86
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:10,257
The breeze now freshened, the sea began to swell.

87
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:11,560
The birds!

88
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:12,522
The birds!

89
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:17,712
cried Tashtego, in long Indian file as when herons take wing.

90
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:27,407
The white birds were now all flying towards Ahab's boat, and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round with joyous expectant cries.

91
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:31,854
Their vision was keener than man's, Ahab could discover no sign in the sea.

92
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:40,307
But suddenly, as he peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel.

93
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:53,419
with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom.

94
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:01,253
It was Moby Dick's open mouth and scrawled jaw, his vast, shadowed bulk still half-blending with the blue of the sea.

95
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:12,994
The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb, and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition.

96
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:23,294
Then, calling upon Fedala to change places with him, went forward to the bowels, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.

97
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:33,413
Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet underwater.

98
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:44,629
But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidlingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.

99
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,701
Through and through, through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back.

100
00:09:52,681 --> 00:10:04,518
in the manner of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrawled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock.

101
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:11,888
The bluish-pearl white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.

102
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:18,087
In this attitude, the white whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat, her mouse.

103
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:27,164
With unastonished eyes, Fadala gazed and crossed his arms, but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the uttermost stern.

104
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:35,479
And now, while both elastic gunwhales were springing in and out, as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way,

105
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:43,798
and from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him as it were.

106
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:59,299
And while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated.

107
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:06,850
Frenzied with all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe.

108
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:27,032
As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him, the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.

109
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:36,647
These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern wreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across.

110
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:53,593
At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time, at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.

111
00:11:53,573 --> 00:12:06,950
But only slipping further into the whale's mouth and tilting over sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw, spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push, and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.

112
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:23,310
Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows, and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body, so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose,

113
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:34,889
Some twenty or more feet out of the water, the now-rising swells, with all their confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it, vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air.

114
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:45,687
So, in a gale, the but half-baffled channel billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.

115
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:48,296
This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.

116
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:59,835
It receives its designation, pitch-polling, from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise of the whale lance in the exercise called pitch-polling, previously described.

117
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:07,708
By this motion, the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.

118
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:20,539
But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew, sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.

119
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:24,027
The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him.

120
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:29,074
as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus' elephants in the Book of Maccabees.

121
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:40,410
Meanwhile Ahab half-smothered in the foam of the whale's insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swim, though he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that.

122
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:46,639
Helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst.

123
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:51,527
From the boat's fragmentary stern, Fidala incuriously and mildly eyed him.

124
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:55,274
The clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not sucker him.

125
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,420
More than enough was it for them to look to themselves.

126
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:09,201
For so revolvingly appalling was the white whale's aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them.

127
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:20,868
And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by, still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all.

128
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,456
Nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape.

129
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:32,135
With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose center had now become the old man's head.

130
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:44,912
Meantime, from the beginning, all this had been described from the ship's massed heads, and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene, and was now so nigh that Ahab in the water hailed her.

131
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:46,534
Sail on, then!

132
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:52,401
But that moment, a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick and whelmed him for the time.

133
00:14:53,140 --> 00:15:00,032
But struggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he shouted, sail on the whale, drive him off.

134
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:07,084
The Pequot's prowls were pointed, and breaking up the charmed circle, she effectually parted the white whale from his victim.

135
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:17,983
As he sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue, dragged into Stubb's boat with bloodshot, blinded eyes, the white brine caking in his wrinkles.

136
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:23,911
The long tension of Ahab's bodily strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom.

137
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:31,621
For a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants.

138
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:38,671
Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.

139
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:44,899
But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it.

140
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:54,744
In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives.

141
00:15:55,525 --> 00:16:14,143
And so, such hearts, though summary in each one's suffering, still, if the gods decree it, in their lifetime aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous intensities, for even in their pointless centers those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.

142
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:19,602
The harpoon, said Ahab, halfway rising, and draggingly leaning on one bended arm.

143
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:20,644
Is it safe?

144
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:22,767
Aye, sir, for it was not darted.

145
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:24,890
This is it, said Stub, showing it.

146
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,251
Lay it before me.

147
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:27,714
Any missing men?

148
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:30,537
One, two, three, four, five.

149
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:33,422
There were five oars, sir, and here are five men.

150
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:34,763
That's good.

151
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:35,825
Help me, man.

152
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,347
I wish to stand.

153
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:50,046
So, so, I see him, there, there, going to leeward still, what a leaping spout, hands off from me, the eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again, set the sail, out oars the helm.

154
00:16:50,707 --> 00:17:02,305
It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat, and the chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.

155
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:03,327
It was thus now.

156
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:32,089
But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin, swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one, nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar, a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude.

157
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:38,342
The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.

158
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:48,222
Accordingly, the boats now made for her and were soon swayed up to their cranes, the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her.

159
00:17:48,303 --> 00:18:01,422
and then hoisting everything to her side and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with stun sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross, the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby Dick.

160
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:08,472
At the well-known methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mastheads.

161
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:12,297
And when he would be reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time.

162
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:19,645
And then pacing the deck, binnacle watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.

163
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,608
Whose is the doubloon now?

164
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:22,609
D'ye see him?

165
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:28,296
And if the reply was, No, sir, straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch.

166
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:31,219
In this way the day wore on.

167
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:46,594
Ahab, now aloft and motionless, Anon unrestingly pacing the planks, as he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still greater breadth.

168
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:59,367
Thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed, broken bow to shattered stern.

169
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:11,459
At last he paused before it, and as in an already overclouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man's face there now stole some such added gloom as this.

170
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:24,612
Stubbs saw him pause, and perhaps intending, not vainly though, to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in his captain's mind, he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimed,

171
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:27,178
The thistle the ass refused.

172
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:29,322
It pricked his mouth too keenly, sir.

173
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:30,063
Ha!

174
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:30,745
Ha!

175
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:34,232
What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?

176
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:35,033
Man!

177
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:35,695
Man!

178
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:39,302
Did I not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical?

179
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:41,286
I could swear thou wert a poltroon.

180
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:45,013
Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.

181
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:50,702
"'Aye, sir,' said Starbuck drawing near, "'tis a solemn sight, an omen, and an ill one."

182
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:51,944
"'Omen?

183
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:52,665
Omen?'

184
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:53,926
The dictionary.

185
00:19:54,367 --> 00:20:01,915
"'If the gods think to speak outright to man, "'they will honorably speak outright, not shake their heads, "'and give an old wife's darkling hint.

186
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,137
"'Begone!

187
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:06,140
Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing.

188
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,225
"'Starbuck is stub reversed, and stub is Starbuck.

189
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:18,414
and ye too are all mankind, and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors.

190
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:21,618
Cold, cold, I shiver.

191
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,281
How now, aloft there!

192
00:20:24,941 --> 00:20:25,582
Do ye see him?

193
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:29,627
Sing out for every spout, though he spout ten times a second.

194
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:34,652
The day was nearly done, only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.

195
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:39,958
Soon it was almost dark, but the lookout-men still remained unset.

196
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:43,603
"'Can't see the spout now, sir, too dark,' cried a voice from the air.

197
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:45,686
"'How heading when last seen?'

198
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:48,129
"'As before, sir, straight to leeward.'

199
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:51,053
"'Good, he will travel slower now, tis night.'

200
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:55,258
"'Down royals and top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck.

201
00:20:55,819 --> 00:21:01,086
We must not run over him before morning, he's making a passage now, and may heave to a while.

202
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:05,811
Helm there, keep her full before the wind, Aloft, come down, Mr. Chaff.

203
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:11,118
Stub, send a fresh hand to the foremast head, And see it man till morning.

204
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:24,593
Then advancing towards the doubloon in the mainmast, Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it, But I shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead, And then, whosoever of ye first raises him,

205
00:21:24,573 --> 00:21:35,156
Upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man's, and if on that day I shall again raise him, then ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye.

206
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:36,359
Away now!

207
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,664
The deck is thine, sir."

208
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:50,850
And so saying, he placed himself half-way within the scuttle, and slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on.
