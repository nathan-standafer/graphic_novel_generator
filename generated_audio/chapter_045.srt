00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:24,250
Chapter 44 Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and, bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea-charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table.

2
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:40,023
Then, seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye, and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank.

3
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:44,753
At intervals he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him.

4
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:54,428
wherein were set down the seasons, and places in which, on various former voyages of various ships, sperm-whales had been captured or seen.

5
00:00:54,448 --> 00:01:02,640
While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship,

6
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:23,295
and forever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.

7
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:31,441
But it was not this night, in particular, that, in the solitude of his cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts.

8
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:40,194
Almost every night they were brought out, almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others were substituted.

9
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:53,333
For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.

10
00:01:53,313 --> 00:02:06,391
Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the Leviathans, it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.

11
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:15,743
But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents, and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm-whale's food,

12
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:34,525
and, also, calling to mind the regular, ascertain seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes, called, arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground, in search of his prey.

13
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:48,238
So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm-whales resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world.

14
00:02:49,239 --> 00:03:03,972
Were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale-fleet carefully collated, then the migrations of the sperm-whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.

15
00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:09,359
On this hint, attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.

16
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,400
Je.

17
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:23,277
Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by an official circular issued by Lieutenant Morey of the National Observatory, Washington, April 16, 1851.

18
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:33,483
By that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion, and portions of it are presented in the circular.

19
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:39,814
This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude.

20
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:56,453
perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns, for the twelve months in and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines, S, one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district,

21
00:03:56,433 --> 00:04:02,603
and the two others to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.

22
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:21,394
Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the sperm-whales, guided by some infallible instinct, say, rather, secret intelligence from the Deity mostly sweep in veins, as they are called, continuing their way along a given ocean-line,

23
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:30,889
with such undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.

24
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:46,875
Though in these cases the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor's paramount, the sum is, that at particular seasons within that breath, and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for.

25
00:04:46,990 --> 00:05:09,066
and hence not only at substantiated times, upon well-known separate feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey, but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.

26
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:15,714
There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme.

27
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,438
But not so in the reality, perhaps.

28
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:33,855
Though the gregarious sperm-whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which halted such and such a latitude or longitude, this year, say,

29
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:47,099
will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season, though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true.

30
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:57,177
In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm-whales.

31
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:20,042
so that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelles Ground in the Indian Ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese coast, yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.

32
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:26,050
So, too, with some other feeding-grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.

33
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:33,880
But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places in ocean ends, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.

34
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:45,355
And where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever wayside antecedent extra-prospects were his

35
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:59,074
ere a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next thing to a certainty.

36
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:06,664
That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase, the season on the line.

37
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:13,654
For there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically described

38
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:23,026
lingering in those waters for a while, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac.

39
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:28,553
There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place.

40
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:31,957
There the waves were storied with his deeds.

41
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:39,827
There also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.

42
00:07:39,807 --> 00:08:07,097
But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes, nor, in the sleeplessness of his vow, could he so tranquilize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quests.

43
00:08:07,077 --> 00:08:12,146
Now the Pequot had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the season on the line.

44
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:27,912
No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards double Cape Horn and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrived in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there.

45
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:32,460
Therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season.

46
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:58,397
Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab with a view to this very complexion of things, because an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him, an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt, if, by chance, the white whale

47
00:08:58,377 --> 00:09:12,690
Spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.

48
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:26,657
so that monsoons, pampas, norwesters, harmatins, trades, any wind but the Nevanta and Simoon might blow Moby Dick into the devious zigzag world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.

49
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:37,328
But granting all this, yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not but a mad idea, this, that in the broad boundless ocean,

50
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:49,056
One solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople.

51
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:57,023
Yes, for the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick and his snow-white hump could not but be unmistakable.

52
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:09,976
And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as, after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries tallied him, and shall he escape?

53
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:16,022
His broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheep's ear.

54
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:28,172
And here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race, till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him, and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength.

55
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:37,350
Ah, God, what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire?

56
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:53,434
He sleeps with clenched hands, and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palm, often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of frenzies,

57
00:10:53,414 --> 00:11:01,081
and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish.

58
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:20,299
And when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual foes in him heaved his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned, yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressible symptoms of some latent weakness,

59
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,985
or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.

60
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:39,703
For, at such times, crazy Ahab the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale, this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again.

61
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:49,695
The latter was the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind

62
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,631
which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent.

63
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:59,736
It spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing.

64
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:03,615
of which, for the time, it was no longer an integral.

65
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:26,655
But, as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose, that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils, into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own.

66
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:29,537
Nay, could grimly live and burn,

67
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:36,786
while the common vitality to which it was conjoined fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth.

68
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:57,771
Therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to color, and therefore a blankness in itself.

69
00:12:57,931 --> 00:12:59,473
God help the old man!

70
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:12,636
Thy thoughts have created a creature in thee, and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus, a Volture feeds upon that heart for ever, that Volture the very creature he creates.
