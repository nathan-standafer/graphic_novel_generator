Chapter 110 - Queequeg and His Coffin

2
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:11,784
Queequeg and His Coffin Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off.

3
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:24,638
So, it being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts, and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above.

4
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:42,960
So deep did they go, and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost punctions, that you almost looked next for some moldy cornerstone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.

5
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:54,253
Tiers after tiers, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get about,

6
00:00:54,233 --> 00:01:02,377
and the hollow hull echoed underfoot as if you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn.

7
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:07,973
Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head.

8
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:10,701
Well was it that the typhoons did not visit them then.

9
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:20,579
Now, at this time, it was that my poor pagan companion and fast bosom friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to his endless end.

10
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,087
Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown.

11
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:29,335
Dignity and danger go hand in hand, till you get to be captain.

12
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:32,340
The higher you rise, the harder you toil.

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:53,326
So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooner, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but, as we have elsewhere seen, mount his dead back in a rolling sea, and finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and sea to their stowage.

14
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:58,632
To be short, among whalemen, the harpooners are the holders, so-called.

15
00:01:58,612 --> 00:01:59,513
Poor Queequeg.

16
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:15,338
When the ship was about half disemboweled, you should have stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there where, stripped to his woolen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime, like a green-spotted lizard at the bottom of a well.

17
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:33,597
And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan, where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever, and at last, after some days' suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death.

18
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:41,409
How he wasted and wasted away in those few long lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing.

19
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:49,543
But as all else in him thinned, and his cheekbones grew sharper, his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller.

20
00:02:49,523 --> 00:03:09,473
They became of a strange softness of luster and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened, and like circles on the water which, as they grow fainter, expand, so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of eternity.

21
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:19,964
An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any beheld who were bystanders when Zorlaster died.

22
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:36,082
For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man never yet was put into words or books, and the drawing near of death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could adequately tell.

23
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:39,105
So that, let us say it again,

24
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:59,433
No dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean's invisible flood tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.

25
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:04,300
Not a man of the crew but gave him up, and, as for Queequeg himself,

26
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,286
What he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favor he asked.

27
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:20,905
He called one to him in the gray morning watch, when the day was just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chance to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich warwood of his native isle.

28
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:30,640
And upon inquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him.

29
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:38,472
For it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe.

30
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:41,778
and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagos.

31
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:58,671
For not only do they believe that the stars are aisles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own miles, he added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual sea custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.

32
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:05,115
No, he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman.

33
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:14,408
That like a whaleboat these coffin canoes were without a keel, though that involved but uncertain steering and much leeway down the dim ages.

34
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:23,460
Now when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg's bidding, whatever it might include.

35
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:35,896
There was some heathenish coffin-colored old lumber aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday Islands, and from these dart planks the coffin was recommended to be made.

36
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:52,975
No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith, with all the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle, and took Queequeg's measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg's person as he shifted the rule.

37
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,797
Ah, poor fellow, he'll have to die now," ejaculated the Long Island sailor.

38
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:12,305
Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities.

39
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:16,932
This done, he marshaled the planks and his tools, and to work.

40
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:27,467
When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.

41
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:51,729
Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to everyone's consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there any denying him, seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical, and certainly, since they will shortly trouble us so little forevermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.

42
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,454
Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye.

43
00:06:57,434 --> 00:07:06,027
He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat.

44
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,475
All by his own request.

45
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:11,179
Also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within.

46
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:21,149
A flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot, and a piece of sailcloth being rolled up for a pillow.

47
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:27,876
Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had.

48
00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:34,343
He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo.

49
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,830
Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid.

50
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,036
Hatch, he called it, to be placed over him.

51
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:51,994
The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Kwee Kweg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view.

52
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:57,545
Brahmai, it will do, it is easy," he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.

53
00:07:57,946 --> 00:08:08,447
But ere this was done Pip, who had been slyly hovering nearby all this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings took him by the hand, in the other holding his tambourine.

54
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:12,133
Poor rover, will ye never have done with all this weary roving?

55
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:13,456
Where go ye now?

56
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:21,570
But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for me?

57
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:24,776
Seek out one Pip who's now been missing long.

58
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:27,921
I think he's in those far Antilles.

59
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:34,555
If ye find him, then comfort him, for he must be very sad, for look, he's left his tambourine behind.

60
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:35,897
I found it.

61
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,863
Rigga, dig, dig, dig.

62
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:43,092
Now, Queequeg, die, and I'll beat ye your dying march.

63
00:08:43,072 --> 00:09:02,211
I have heard," murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, that in violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues, and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood, those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars.

64
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:09,860
So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes.

65
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:12,564
Where learned he that, but there?

66
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:16,408
Hark, he speaks again, but more wildly now.

67
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,933
Form two and two, let's make a general of him.

68
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,015
Ho, where's his harpoon?

69
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:23,517
Lay it across here.

70
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,020
Rig a dig, dig, dig, huzzah.

71
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:30,105
Oh, for a gamecock now to sit upon his head and crow.

72
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:46,879
Queequeg dies game, Mind he that, Queequeg dies game, Take ye good heat of that, Queequeg dies game, Take ye good heat of that, Queequeg dame, But base little Pip, He died a coward, Died all a shiver, Out upon Pip.

73
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:52,936
Harky, if ye find Pip, tell all the Antilles he's a runaway, a coward, a coward, a coward.

74
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:55,503
Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat.

75
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,291
I'd never beat my tambourine over Bass Pip.

76
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:01,881
And hail him general if he were once more dying here.

77
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,003
No, no!

78
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:04,727
Shame upon all cowards!

79
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:05,849
Shame upon them!

80
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:09,476
Let him go drown like Pip, that jumped from a whale boat!

81
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,138
Shame!

82
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:10,879
Shame!

83
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:15,228
During all this, Kwee Kweg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.

84
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:19,296
Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.

85
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:26,887
But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death, now that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied.

86
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:37,943
Soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box, and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted surprise, he in substance said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this.

87
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:46,235
At a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone, and therefore had changed his mind about dying.

88
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:48,979
He could not die yet, he averred.

89
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,826
They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.

90
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:56,848
He answered, Certainly.

91
00:10:57,849 --> 00:11:11,625
In a word it was Queequeg's conceit that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him, nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.

92
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:25,103
Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized, that while a sick, civilized man may be six months' convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half well again in a day.

93
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:34,997
So, in good time my kwee-kweg gained strength, and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days, but eating with a vigorous appetite,

94
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:47,399
He suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.

95
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,715
With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest, and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.

96
00:11:56,695 --> 00:12:09,211
Many spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings, and it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body.

97
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:23,850
And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth,

98
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:35,815
so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold, a wondrous work in one volume, but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart beat against them.

99
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:42,970
And these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed.

100
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:45,507
and so be unsolved to the last.

101
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:59,001
And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg, O devilish tantalization of the gods!
