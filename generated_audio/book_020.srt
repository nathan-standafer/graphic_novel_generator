Book XXULUSIS CANNOT SLEEP.

2
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:07,322
P. ELLIP'S PRAYER TO DIANA, THE TWO SIGNS FROM HEAVEN.

3
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:10,387
EUMEES AND PHYLOETUS ARRIVE.

4
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:15,174
THE SUETORS DINE, SYCHYTEPES THROWS AN OX'S FOOT AT ULYSSES.

5
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:19,120
THEOCLYMANUS FRITELLS DISASTER AND LEAVES THE HOUSE.

6
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:31,241
Ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock's hide, on the top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten, and Eurynum 156 threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down.

7
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:44,618
There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which he should kill the suitors, and by and by the women who had been in the habit of misconducting themselves with them left the house giggling and laughing with one another.

8
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:53,629
This made Ulysses very angry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every single one of them then and there, or to let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors.

9
00:00:54,233 --> 00:01:03,665
His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did his heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done.

10
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:07,149
But he beat his breast and said, Heart, be still.

11
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:17,342
You had worse than this to bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions, yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made sure of being killed.

12
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:21,287
Thus he chided with his heart and checked it into endurance.

13
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:30,255
What he tossed about is one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other, that he may get it cooked as soon as possible.

14
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:34,358
Even so did he turn himself about from side to side, thinking of his wife.

15
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:42,785
But by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head, saying, My poor unhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way?

16
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:50,532
This is your house, your wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father may be proud of.

17
00:01:50,512 --> 00:02:01,145
"'Goddess,' answered Ulysses, "'all that you have said is true, but I am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors single-handed, seeing what a number of them there always are.

18
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:05,070
And there is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable.

19
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:14,342
Supposing that with Jove's and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must ask you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it is all over.'"

20
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:23,865
"'For shame,' replied Minerva, "'why, anyone else would trust a worse ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less wise than I am.

21
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:28,132
Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout in all your troubles?

22
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:37,748
I tell you plainly that even though there were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you should take all their sheep and cattle and drive them away with you.'"

23
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:38,590
But go to sleep.

24
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:43,459
It is a very bad thing to lie awake all night, and you shall be out of your troubles before long."

25
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:48,189
As she spoke, she shed sleep over his eyes and then went back to Olympus.

26
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:58,690
While Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that eased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke and, sitting up in her bed, began to cry.

27
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:17,370
When she had relieved herself by weeping, she prayed to Diana, saying, Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove, drive an arrow into my heart and slay me, or let some whirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the mouths of overflowing Oceanus, as it did the daughters of Pandareus.

28
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,316
The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans.

29
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:27,562
But Venus took care of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine.

30
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:31,847
Juno taught them to excel all women in beauty of form and understanding.

31
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:37,394
Diana gave them an imposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment.

32
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:46,024
But one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting them married, for well does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to everyone,

33
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:50,985
The storm-winds came and spirited them away to become handmaids to the dread Erynges.

34
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:57,419
Even so, I wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair Diana might strike me.

35
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:06,679
For I would fain go even beneath the sad earth if I might do so, still looking towards Ulysses only, and without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was.

36
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:19,456
Besides, no matter how much people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget good and ill alike, whereas my misery haunts me even in my dreams.

37
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:31,131
This very night me thought there was one lying by my side who was like Ulysses as he was when he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream but the very truth itself.

38
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:39,059
On this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by his side.

39
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,485
Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister.

40
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:47,188
But he took the bullock's hide out into the open.

41
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:56,798
He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed, saying, Father Jove, since you have seen fit to bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me.

42
00:04:56,778 --> 00:05:03,754
Give me a sign out of the mouth of someone or other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind from outside."

43
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:12,154
Jove heard his prayer, and forthwith thundered high up among the clouds from the splendor of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad when he heard it.

44
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:18,482
At the same time within the house, a miller woman from hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another sign.

45
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:24,650
There were twelve miller women whose business it was to grind wheat and barley which are the staff of life.

46
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:36,825
The others had ground their task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet finished for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heard the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.

47
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:45,721
Father Jove said she, You who rule over heaven and earth, you have thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and this means something for somebody.

48
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:53,915
Grant the prayer, then, of me, your poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very last day that the suitors dine in the house of Ulysses.

49
00:05:54,476 --> 00:06:01,108
They have worn me out with labor of grinding meal for them, and I hope they may never have another dinner anywhere at all.

50
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,990
Ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman's speech and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should avenge himself on the suitors.

51
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:13,674
Then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth.

52
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:16,477
Telemachus also rose and put on his clothes.

53
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:24,987
He girded his sword about his shoulder, bound his sandals onto his comely feet, and took a doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze.

54
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:34,799
Then he went to the threshold of the cloister and said to Eurycleia, Nurse, did you make the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let him shift for himself?

55
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:43,509
For my mother, good woman though she is, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate people, and of neglecting others who are in reality much better men.

56
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,236
Do not find fault, child, said Eurycleia, when there is no one to find fault with.

57
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:52,105
The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked.

58
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:56,210
Your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread, and he said he would not.

59
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,675
When he wanted to go to bed, she told the servants to make one for him.

60
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:04,421
But he said he was such a wretched outcast that he would not sleep on a bed and under blankets.

61
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:11,950
He insisted on having an undressed bullock's hide and some sheepskins put for him in the cloister, and I threw a cloak over him myself.

62
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,531
157.

63
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:17,919
Then Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans were meeting in assembly.

64
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,185
He had his spear in his hand, and he was not alone, for his two dogs went with him.

65
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:39,591
But Eurycleia called the maids and said, Come, wake up, set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the dust, put the covers on the seats, wipe down the tables, some of you with a wet sponge, clean out the mixing jugs and the cups, and go for water from the fountain at once,

66
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:43,938
The suitors will be here directly, they will be here early, for it is a feast day."

67
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,994
Thus did she speak, and they did even as she had said, twenty of them went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to work about the house.

68
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:58,002
The men who were in attendance on the suitors also came up and began chopping firewood.

69
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:03,784
By and by the women returned from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three best pigs he could pick out.

70
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:15,041
These he let feed about the premises, and then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses, Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?

71
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:24,175
May heaven, answered Ulysses, requite to them the wickedness with which they deal high-handedly in another man's house without any sense of shame.

72
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:33,861
Thus did they converse, meanwhile Melanthius the goat-herd came up, for he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitor's dinner, and he had two shepherds with him.

73
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:39,396
They tied the goats up under the gatehouse, and then Melanthius began jibing at Ulysses.

74
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:41,849
you still here, stranger?"

75
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,794
said he, to pester people by begging about the house.

76
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,737
Why can you not go elsewhere?

77
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:51,544
You and I shall not come to an understanding before we have given each other a taste of our fists.

78
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:54,229
You beg without any sense of decency.

79
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,195
Are there not feasts elsewhere among the Achaeans, as well as here?

80
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,724
Ulysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded.

81
00:09:01,764 --> 00:09:07,511
Then a third man, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and some goats.

82
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:12,317
These were brought over by the boatmen, who are there to take people over when anyone comes to them.

83
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:17,943
So Philoetius made his heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to the swineherd.

84
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:19,345
"'Who, swineherd?'

85
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:20,166
said he.

86
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:22,249
Is this stranger that is lately come here?

87
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,591
Is he one of your men?

88
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:24,872
What is his family?

89
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,054
Where does he come from?"

90
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,396
Poor fellow!

91
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:34,085
He looks as if he had been some great man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will, even to kings if it so pleases them.

92
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:37,990
As he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand.

93
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,734
"'Good day to you, father stranger,' said he.

94
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:45,681
You seem to be very poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and by."

95
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:48,587
Father Jove, of all gods you are the most malicious.

96
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:53,437
We are your own children, yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions.

97
00:09:54,259 --> 00:10:05,121
A sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for he reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going about in just such rags as this man's are, if indeed he is still among the living.

98
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:08,867
If he is already dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas!

99
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:20,223
For my good master, who made me his stockman when I was quite young among the Cephalenians, and now his cattle are countless, no one could have done better with them than I have, for they have bred like ears of corn.

100
00:10:20,444 --> 00:10:33,403
Nevertheless, I have to keep bringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed to his son, though he is in the house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager to divide Ulysses' property among them, because he has been away so long.

101
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:39,871
I have often thought, only it would not be right, while his son is living, of going off with the cattle to some foreign country.

102
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:45,338
Bad as this would be, it is still harder to stay here and be ill-treated about other people's herds.

103
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:58,294
My position is intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself under the protection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet return and send all these suitors flying out of the house.

104
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:04,445
"'Stopman,' answered Ulysses, "'you seem to be a very well-disposed person, and I can see that you are a man of sense.

105
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:07,850
Therefore I will tell you, and will confirm my words with an oath.

106
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:21,514
By Jove, the chief of all gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come, Ulysses shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so minded, you shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here.'"

107
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:27,781
"'If Jove were to bring this to pass,' replied the stockman, "'you should see how I would do my very utmost to help him.'

108
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:32,546
And in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.

109
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,488
Thus did they converse.

110
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:42,577
Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to murder Telemachus, but a bird flew near them on their left hand, an eagle with a dove in its talons.

111
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:48,124
On this Amphenomus said, "'My friends, this plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed.

112
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:50,286
Let us go to dinner instead.'

113
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:54,875
The others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the benches and seats.

114
00:11:54,895 --> 00:12:00,846
They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round.

115
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:11,346
They mixed the wine in the mixing bowls, and the swineherd gave every man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in the breadbaskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine.

116
00:12:11,326 --> 00:12:14,151
Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.

117
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:19,662
Telemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that was paved with stone.

118
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:28,779
One-fifty-eight he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought to him with his wine in a gold cup.

119
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:33,368
Sit there, said he, and drink your wine among the great people.

120
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:41,605
I will put a stop to the jibes and blows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but belongs to Ulysses and is passed from him to me.

121
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:47,998
Therefore, suitors, keep your hands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be mischief.

122
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:52,171
The suitors bit their lips and marveled at the boldness of his speech.

123
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:58,939
Then Antinous said, We do not like such language, but we will put up with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest.

124
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:02,823
If Jove had led us, we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now.

125
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:06,347
Thus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not.

126
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:13,615
Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy Hecatomb through the city, and the Achaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.

127
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:20,328
Then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man his portion, and feasted to their hearts' content.

128
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:27,080
Those who waited at table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for Telemachus had told them to do so.

129
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:34,995
But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against them.

130
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:41,146
Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was Catesippus, and who came from Same.

131
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:48,759
This man, confident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife of Ulysses, and said to the suitors, Hear what I have to say.

132
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,265
The stranger has already had as large a portion as anyone else.

133
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:57,834
This is well, for it is not right nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here.

134
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:01,540
I will, however, make him a present on my own account,

135
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,928
that he may have something to give to the bath-woman or to some other of Ulysses' servants.

136
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:17,387
As he spoke, he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket in which it lay and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little aside and avoided it, smiling grimly.

137
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:22,937
Sardinian fashion fifty-nine as he did so, and it hit the wall, not him.

138
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:25,805
On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to Citesippus.

139
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:30,658
It is a good thing for you, said he, that the stranger turned his head so that you missed him.

140
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:38,479
If you had hit him I should have run you through with my spear, and your father would have had to see about getting you buried rather than married in this house.

141
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:49,521
So let me have no more unseemly behavior from any of you, for I am grown up now to the knowledge of good and evil, and understand what is going on, instead of being the child that I have been heretofore.

142
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,190
I have long seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine,

143
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,302
I have put up with this, for one man is no match for many, but do me no further violence.

144
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:11,031
Still, if ye wish to kill me, kill me, I would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes, day after day, guests insulted, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way.

145
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:19,826
They all held their peace till at last Agalaos son of Damasta said, no one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it, for it is quite reasonable.

146
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:26,416
Leave off therefore ill-treating the stranger, or anyone else of the servants who are about the house, I would say.

147
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:31,885
However, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother, which I trust may commend itself to both.

148
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:40,798
As long, I would say, as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home, no one could complain of your waiting and suffering.

149
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,162
160 the suitors to be in your house.

150
00:15:44,004 --> 00:15:56,826
It would have been better that he should have returned, but it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so, therefore talk all this quietly over with your mother and tell her to marry the best man and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer.

151
00:15:57,347 --> 00:16:05,622
Thus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance and to eat and drink in peace, while your mother will look after some other man's house, not yours.

152
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:17,606
To this Telemachus answered, By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of my unhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca or is wandering in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother's marriage.

153
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:29,666
On the contrary, I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and I will give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist point-blank that she shall leave the house against her own wishes.

154
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:32,250
Heaven forbid that I should do this.

155
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:39,618
Minerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately and set their wits wandering, but they were laughing with a forced laughter.

156
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:45,788
Their meat became smeared with blood, their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts were heavy with forebodings.

157
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,653
Theoclymenus saw this and said,

158
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,856
Unhappy men, what is it that ails you?

159
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,482
There is a shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot.

160
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:56,285
Your cheeks are wet with tears.

161
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:58,648
The air is alive with wailing voices.

162
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:00,772
The walls and roof beams drip blood.

163
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:05,860
The gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full of ghosts, trooping down into the night of hell.

164
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,206
The sun is blotted out of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land.

165
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:13,932
Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily.

166
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:18,542
Eurymachus then said, This stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses.

167
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:23,051
Servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it so dark here.

168
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:27,621
But Theoclymenus said, Eurymachus, you need not send anyone with me.

169
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:32,511
I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own to say nothing of an understanding mind.

170
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:43,365
I will take these out of the house with me, for I see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who are insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be able to escape."

171
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:47,590
He left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him welcome.

172
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:52,575
But the suitors kept looking at one another, and provoking Telemachus by laughing at the strangers.

173
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:57,321
One insolent fellow said to him, "'Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests.

174
00:17:57,862 --> 00:18:01,806
First you have this unfortunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine,

175
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:09,319
and has no skill for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as a prophet.

176
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:16,793
Let me persuade you, for it will be much better to put them on board ship and send them off to the Seychelles to sell for what they will bring."

177
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:25,448
Telemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father, expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.

178
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:33,847
Meanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she could hear what everyone was saying.

179
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:37,054
The dinner indeed had been prepared amid much merriment.

180
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:51,587
It had been both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed many victims, but the supper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a brave man were soon to lay before them, for they had brought their doom upon themselves.
