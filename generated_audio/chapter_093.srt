00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:23,254
Chapter 93 - The Castaway. It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's crew—an event most lamentable, and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever-accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.

2
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:26,984
Now, in the whale ship, it is not everyone that goes in the boats.

3
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:33,981
Some few hands a reserve called shipkeepers, whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale.

4
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:40,618
As a general thing, these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boat's crews.

5
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:47,895
But if there happened to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous white in the ship, that white is certain to be made a shipkeeper.

6
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:54,270
It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nickname, Pip by abbreviation.

7
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:55,272
Poor Pip!

8
00:00:55,773 --> 00:01:01,602
Ye have heard of him before, ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy jolly.

9
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:12,879
In outer aspect, Pip and Doe, boy made a match, like a black pony and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in one eccentric span.

10
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:18,368
But while hapless Doe-boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects,

11
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:33,337
Pip, though over-tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe—a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race.

12
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,812
For blacks, the year's calendar should show naught but 365 Fourth of Julies and New Year's days.

13
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:50,932
nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy, behold yon lustrous ebony panelled in king's cabinets.

14
00:01:51,513 --> 00:02:00,471
But Pip loved life, and all life's peaceable securities, so that the panic-striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped,

15
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:30,205
had most sadly blurred his brightness, though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural luster with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the green, and at Melodious even tide, with his gay, ha-ha, had turned the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine,

16
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:50,961
So, though in the clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow, yet, when the cunning jeweler would show you the diamond in its most impressive luster, he lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases.

17
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:55,621
Then come out those fiery effulgences, infernally superb.

18
00:02:56,182 --> 00:03:05,656
Then the evil blazing diamond, once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown jewel stolen from the king of hell.

19
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,680
But let us to the story.

20
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:21,860
It came to pass that in the ambergris affair Stubbs after Orsman chanced so, to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed, and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.

21
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:33,655
The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness, but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale, and therefore came off not altogether discreditably.

22
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:42,598
Though Stubb, observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.

23
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:53,748
Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale, and as the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.

24
00:03:54,349 --> 00:04:10,425
The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat, and in such a way that part of the slack whale-line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water.

25
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:16,299
That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened, and presto!

26
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:26,091
Poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.

27
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,493
Tashtego stood in the bows.

28
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:29,876
He was full of the fire of the hunt.

29
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,118
He hated Pip for a poltroon.

30
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,328
Snatching the boat knife from its sheath, he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb exclaimed interrogatively,

31
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:48,181
Meanwhile, Pip's blue, choked face plainly looked, do for God's sake, all passed in a flash.

32
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:51,549
In less than half a minute, this entire thing happened.

33
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:57,642
Damn him, cut, roared Stubb, and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved.

34
00:04:58,145 --> 00:05:03,792
So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew.

35
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:17,790
Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate, Stub then, in a plain, business-like, but still half-humorous manner, cursed Pip officially, and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.

36
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:22,500
The substance was, never jump from a boat, Pip, except.

37
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:26,730
But all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.

38
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:36,572
Now, in general, stick to the boat, is your true motto in whaling, but cases will sometimes happen when leap from the boat is still better.

39
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:46,343
Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted, conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future.

40
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:51,210
Stubbs suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command.

41
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:55,718
Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump, mind that.

42
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,803
We can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you.

43
00:05:58,823 --> 00:06:03,370
A whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.

44
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,992
Bear that in mind and don't jump anymore."

45
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:16,442
Hereby, perhaps, Stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.

46
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:20,285
But we are all in the hands of the gods, and Pip jumped again.

47
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:33,357
It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance, but this time he did not breast out the line, and hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveler's trunk.

48
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:37,362
Alas, Stubb was but too true to his word.

49
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:49,035
It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day, the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremist.

50
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:54,161
Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.

51
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:57,925
No boat knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.

52
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:02,010
Stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him, and the whale was winged.

53
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,357
In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stub.

54
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:14,531
Out from the center of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.

55
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:22,424
Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practiced swimmer as to ride in a spring carriage ashore.

56
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:26,631
But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable.

57
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:33,550
The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God, who can tell it?

58
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:42,317
Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea, mark how closely they hud their ship and only coast along her sides.

59
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:46,524
But had Stub really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?

60
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:49,709
No, he did not mean to, at least.

61
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:57,883
Because there were two boats in his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly and pick him up,

62
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:06,806
Though, indeed, such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances.

63
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:14,286
And such instances not unfrequently occur, almost invariably in the fishery, a coward so-called,

64
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:19,074
is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.

65
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:27,968
But it so happened that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying whales close to them on one side, turned and gave chase.

66
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:38,265
And Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably.

67
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:49,200
By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him, but from that hour the little negro went about the deck, an idiot such, at least, they said he was.

68
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:54,497
The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.

69
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:14,462
Not drowned entirely, though, rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes, and the miser merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps, and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities,

70
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:22,243
Pip saw the multitudinous god-omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs.

71
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:29,582
He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it, and therefore his shipmates called him mad.

72
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:45,703
So man's insanity is heaven's sense, and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and frantic, and wheel or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as his God.

73
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:49,007
For the rest, blame not stub too hardly.

74
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:57,358
The thing is common in that fishery, and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself.
