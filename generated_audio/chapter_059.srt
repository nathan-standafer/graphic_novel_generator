Chapter 59 - Squid

3
00:00:03,656 --> 00:00:22,663
Slowly wading through the meadows of Brit, the Pequod still held on her way north, eastward towards the island of Java, a gentle air impelling her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze as three mild palms on a plain.

4
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:28,108
And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely, alluring jet would be seen.

5
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:47,908
But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm, when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them, enjoining some secrecy, when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on,

6
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:54,337
In this profound hush of the visible sphere, a strange specter was seen by Dagu from the mainmast head.

7
00:00:55,158 --> 00:01:12,133
In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before our prow like a snowslide, new slid from the hills, thus glistening for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank.

8
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:16,157
Then once more arose and silently gleamed.

9
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:19,544
It seemed not a whale, and yet is this Moby Dick?

10
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:20,526
thought Dagu.

11
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,770
Again the phantom went down.

12
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:31,147
But on reappearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod, the negro yelled out, There!

13
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:32,128
There again!

14
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:33,431
There she breaches!

15
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:34,353
Right ahead!

16
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:35,695
The white whale!

17
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:36,998
The white whale!

18
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,878
Upon this the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming time the bees rushed to the boughs.

19
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:57,940
Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the boughsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Dagu.

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:10,515
whether the flitting attendance of the one still in solitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued.

21
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:23,691
However this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him, whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.

22
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:29,420
The four boats were soon on the water, Ahabs in advance, and all swiftly pulling towards their prey.

23
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:36,311
Soon it went down, and while, with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo!

24
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:41,359
In the same spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose.

25
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:50,555
Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind.

26
00:02:51,356 --> 00:03:07,363
A vast, pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing cream color, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms radiating from its center and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.

27
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:18,856
No perceptible face or front did it have, no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct, but undulated there on the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.

28
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:34,735
As with a low-sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice exclaimed, Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to have seen thee, thou white ghost.

29
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,617
What was it, sir?"

30
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:36,819
said Flask.

31
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,690
The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and returned to their ports to tell of it.

32
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:45,433
But Ahab said nothing.

33
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:50,582
Turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel, the rest as silently following.

34
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:56,773
Whatever superstitions the sperm-whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object,

35
00:03:56,922 --> 00:04:04,171
Certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness.

36
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:16,346
So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form.

37
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:21,512
Notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm-whale his only food.

38
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:38,639
For though other species of whales find their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface, and only by inference is it that anyone can tell of what, precisely, that food consists.

39
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:49,255
At times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid, some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length,

40
00:04:50,078 --> 00:05:01,795
They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean, and that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.

41
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:09,466
There seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of Bishop Pontopadan may ultimately resolve itself into squid.

42
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:19,680
The manner in which the bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking with some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond.

43
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:24,021
but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.

44
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:39,475
By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttlefish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.
