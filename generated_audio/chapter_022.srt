00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,652
CHAPTER XXII.

2
00:00:01,192 --> 00:00:01,913
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

3
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:27,726
At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward, after all this, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and, turning to the chief

4
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:29,451
Peleg said to Kwanom.

5
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:41,665
Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure Captain Ahab has already just spoke to him nothing more, to be got from shore, eh?"

6
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:47,423
No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg," said Bildad.

7
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:51,310
But away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.

8
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:52,672
How now!"

9
00:00:53,674 --> 00:01:02,168
Here, upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter-deck

10
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:08,075
just as if they were to be joint commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in port.

11
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:13,621
And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen only.

12
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,403
They said he was in the cabin.

13
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:25,114
But then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under way and steering her well out to sea.

14
00:01:25,354 --> 00:01:28,898
Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business.

15
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:49,030
But the pilots, and as he was not yet completely recovered so, they said, therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below, and all this seemed natural enough, especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor.

16
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:58,769
but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.

17
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,801
But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Pellig was now all alive.

18
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,330
He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and not Bildad,

19
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:16,402
"'Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,' he cried, as the sailors lingered at the main-mast.

20
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:19,285
Mr. Starbuck, drive him aft."

21
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,887
"'Strike the tent there,' was the next order.

22
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:37,343
As I hinted before, this whale-bone marquee was never pitched except in port, and on board the Pequod for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.

23
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,809
Man the capstan!

24
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,115
Blood and thunder!

25
00:02:40,437 --> 00:02:42,425
Jump!"

26
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:46,101
was the next command, and the crew sprang for the hand-spikes.

27
00:02:47,482 --> 00:03:06,693
Now in getting under way, the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship, and here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots of the port he being suspected, to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot fee to all the ships he was concerned in.

28
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:15,126
For he never piloted any other craft, Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor.

29
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:30,583
Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod.

30
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:40,036
particularly in getting under way, and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman's berth.

31
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:48,166
Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Pellike ripped and swore a stern in the most frightful manner.

32
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:53,854
I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up up and voluntarily

33
00:03:55,792 --> 00:04:05,822
I paused on my hand-spike and told Cuiquid to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot.

34
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:22,018
I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in Pius Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and, turning round,

35
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:29,029
was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity.

36
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:30,777
That was my first kick.

37
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,843
Is that the way they heave In the marching service?"

38
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:35,624
he roared.

39
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:39,551
"'Spring, thou sheep-head, spring, And break thy backbone!

40
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:41,473
Why don't ye spring, I say?

41
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:42,515
All of ye spring!'

42
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:43,757
Quahog!

43
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:50,367
"'Spring, thou chap with the red whiskers, Spring there, Scotch-cap spring, Thou green pants!

44
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:51,369
Spring, I say!

45
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:54,233
All of ye, And spring your eyes out!'

46
00:04:54,415 --> 00:05:04,594
and so same he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his salmity.

47
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:08,982
Thinks I Captain Pallack must have been drinking something to-day.

48
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,111
At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided.

49
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:27,797
It was a short cold Christmas, and as the short northern day emerged into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor.

50
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:39,192
The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight, and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.

51
00:05:39,412 --> 00:05:56,113
Lank billed at, as Pilate headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the old craft deep-dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were heard,

52
00:05:56,093 --> 00:06:00,701
Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood Stand dressed in living green.

53
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:05,449
So to the Jews old Canaan stood While Jordan rolled between.

54
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:10,277
Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then.

55
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:16,448
They were full of hope and fruition, spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic,

56
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:33,458
Spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, There was yet, it then seemed to me, Many a pleasant haven in store, And meads and glades so eternally vernal That the grass shot up by the spring, Untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.

57
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:38,227
At last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed no longer.

58
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:43,196
The stout sailboat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside.

59
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:50,350
It was curious, and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture.

60
00:06:50,330 --> 00:07:16,033
Especially Captain Bilbad, for loath to depart, yet very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long in peril as a voyage beyond both stormy capes, a ship in which some thousands of his hard-earned dollars were invested, a ship in which an old ship-mate sailed as captain as captain, a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw of Lothal, to good-bye to Heary the way so every way brimful of every interest to him.

61
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:22,106
Poor old Bildad lingered long, long and long, to pace the deck with anxious strides, ran down into the cabin to speak.

62
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:32,487
As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher, but for all his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near.

63
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,504
And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck.

64
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:41,790
Now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.

65
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,474
But at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about him.

66
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:48,397
Captain Bildad come, old shipmate.

67
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:49,238
We must go.

68
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,140
Back the main yard there.

69
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,181
Boat ahoy.

70
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:55,125
Stand by to come close alongside now.

71
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:57,007
Careful, careful.

72
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,010
Come, Bildad boy, say your last.

73
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:12,352
Luck to ye, Starbuck luck to ye, Mr. Stubb luck to ye, Mr. Flast good-bye, and good luck to ye all, and this day three years I'll have a hot supper smoking for you in old Nantucket.

74
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:14,095
Hurrah, and away!

75
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:22,369
God bless ye, and have you in his holy keeping, men," murmured old Bildad, almost incoherently.

76
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:33,966
I hope you'll have fine weather now, so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye a pleasant sun, is all he needs, and you'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.

77
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,669
Be careful in the hunt, ye mates.

78
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:44,382
Don't stave the boats needlessly, yet Harp O'Neill's good white cedar plank is raised full three percent, within the year.

79
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:46,325
Don't forget your prayers either.

80
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,833
Mr. Starbuck, mind that Cooper don't waste the spare staves.

81
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:54,744
Oh, the sail needles are in the green locker.

82
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:59,623
Don't wail it too much, a lord stays men, but don't miss a fair chance either.

83
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:02,413
That's rejecting heaven's good gifts.

84
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:07,965
Mm, have an eye to the molasses' tears, Mr. Stubb.

85
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:09,689
It was a little leaky, I thought.

86
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,777
If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication.

87
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:16,242
Good-bye, good-bye.

88
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:20,009
Don't keep that cheese too long down in the hole, Mr. Starbuck.

89
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,011
It'll spoil.

90
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,857
Be careful with the butter twenty cents the pound it was.

91
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:26,562
And mind ye, if—

92
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:30,068
Come, come, Captain Bildad's stop, palavering!"

93
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,637
And with that Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropped into the boat.

94
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:41,788
Ship and boat diverged, the cold damp night breeze blew, between a screaming gull flew overhead.

95
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:50,743
The two hulls wildly rolled, we gave three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged, like fate, into the lone Atlantic.
