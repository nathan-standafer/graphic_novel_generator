00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:21,145
Chapter 22 - Merry Christmas. At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whaleboat with her last giftâ€”a nightcap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward.

2
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:31,635
After all this, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said, Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right?

3
00:00:32,356 --> 00:00:34,820
Captain Ahab is all ready, just spoke to him.

4
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,063
Nothing more to be got from shore, eh?

5
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:41,108
Well, call all hands then, muster him aft here, blast him.

6
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:48,055
No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Pelag, said Bildad, but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.

7
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:48,876
How now!

8
00:00:49,476 --> 00:01:02,509
Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain Pelag and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarterdeck, just as if they were to be joint commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in port.

9
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,977
And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen, only, they said he was in the cabin.

10
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:18,809
But then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship underway and steering her well out to sea.

11
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:25,961
Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's, and as he was not yet completely recovered.

12
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:27,363
So they said.

13
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:30,889
Therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below.

14
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:47,999
And all this seemed natural enough, especially as in the merchant service, many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.

15
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,406
But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg was now all alive.

16
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:58,092
He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and not Bildad.

17
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,187
"'Aft here, ye sons of bachelors!'

18
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:03,131
he cried, as the sailors lingered at the main mast.

19
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:03,992
"'Mr.

20
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:05,374
Starbuck, drive him aft!'

21
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:07,196
"'Strike the tent there!'

22
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:08,758
was the next order.

23
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:22,476
As I hinted before, this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port, and on board the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.

24
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:23,398
Man the capstan!

25
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:24,501
Blood and thunder!

26
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:25,283
Jump!"

27
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:29,274
was the next command, and the crew sprang for the hand spikes.

28
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:36,533
Now in getting underway, the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship.

29
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:54,268
And here Bildad, who, with Peleg be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots of the port, he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot fee to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft.

30
00:02:54,248 --> 00:03:11,110
Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands of the windlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Buble Alley with hearty goodwill.

31
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:24,412
Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in getting underway, and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman's berth.

32
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:31,343
Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and swore a stern in the most frightful manner.

33
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:34,491
I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up.

34
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:45,518
Involuntarily I paused on my hand spike and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot.

35
00:03:45,565 --> 00:04:03,262
I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his 777th lay, when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and, turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity.

36
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:05,447
That was my first kick.

37
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:08,376
Is that the way they heave in the Marchant's service?"

38
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:09,257
he roared.

39
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:13,304
Spring, thou sheep-head, spring, and break thy backbone.

40
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:16,690
Why don't ye spring, I say, all of ye, spring.

41
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:23,381
Quill-hog, spring, thou chap with the red whiskers, spring there, Scotch-cap, spring, thou green pants.

42
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:27,688
Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out.

43
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:35,512
And so saying, he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody.

44
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:39,117
Thinks I, Captain Peleg, must have been drinking something today.

45
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:43,382
At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided.

46
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:56,680
It was a short cold Christmas, and as the short northern day merged into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.

47
00:04:56,845 --> 00:05:06,754
The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight, and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.

48
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:21,639
Lank Bildad as pilot headed the first watch, and ever and a nun, as the old craft deep-dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were heard.

49
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,970
Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stan dressed in living green,

50
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:31,810
So to the Jews old Canaan stood, while Jordan rolled between.

51
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,594
Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then.

52
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:38,096
They were full of hope and fruition.

53
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:58,054
Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store, and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.

54
00:05:58,034 --> 00:06:02,492
At last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed no longer.

55
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:06,957
stout sailboat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside.

56
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:14,488
It was curious and not unpleasing how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad.

57
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:28,108
For loathe to depart, yet very loathe to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage, beyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of his hard-earned dollars were invested,

58
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:41,468
a ship in which an old shipmate sailed as captain, a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw, loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way, brimful of every interest to him.

59
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:49,219
Poor old Bildad lingered long, paced the deck with anxious strides, ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there.

60
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,887
again came on deck and looked to windward, looked towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded.

61
00:06:55,227 --> 00:07:03,959
As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher, but for all his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near.

62
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,904
And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck.

63
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:12,290
Now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.

64
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:18,278
But, at last, he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about him.

65
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:19,814
Captain Bildad.

66
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:22,357
Come, old shipmate, we must go.

67
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:24,198
Back the main yard there.

68
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,239
Boat ahoy.

69
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,782
Stand by to come close alongside, now.

70
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:29,604
Careful, careful.

71
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:32,266
Come, Bildad boy, say your last.

72
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:33,988
Luck to ye, Starbuck.

73
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,469
Luck to ye, Mr. Stub.

74
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,071
Luck to ye, Mr. Flask.

75
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:44,198
Goodbye and good luck to ye all, and this day, three years, I'll have a hot supper smoking for ye in Old Nantucket.

76
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:45,300
"'Hurrah and away!

77
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,212
God bless ye, and have ye in his holy keeping, men,' murmured old Bildad, almost incoherently.

78
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:56,383
"'I hope you'll have fine weather now so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye.

79
00:07:56,403 --> 00:08:01,613
A pleasant sun is all he needs, and you'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.'"

80
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:04,460
Be careful in the hunt, ye mates.

81
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,903
Don't stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooners.

82
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:10,227
Good white cedar plank is raised full three percent.

83
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:11,489
Within the year.

84
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:13,551
Don't forget your prayers either.

85
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:17,395
Mr. Starbuck, mind that Cooper don't waste the spare staves.

86
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,959
Oh, the sail needles are in the green locker.

87
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,882
Don't wail it too much.

88
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:24,403
A Lord's Day's, men.

89
00:08:24,864 --> 00:08:26,686
But don't miss a fair chance either.

90
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:29,389
That's rejecting heaven's good gifts.

91
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:32,548
Have an eye to the molasses tears, Mr. Stubb.

92
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,132
It was a little leaky, I thought.

93
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:39,178
If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication.

94
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,940
Goodbye, goodbye.

95
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:44,205
Don't keep that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck.

96
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,267
It'll spoil.

97
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:47,229
Be careful with the butter.

98
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,195
Twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if.

99
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,618
Come, come, Captain Bildad.

100
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,800
Stop palavering.

101
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,102
Away.

102
00:08:56,082 --> 00:09:00,254
And with that, Peleg hurried him over the side and both dropped into the boat.

103
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,080
Ship and boat diverged.

104
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:04,868
The cold, damp night breeze blew between.

105
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:07,074
A screaming gull flew overhead.

106
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,281
The two hulls wildly rolled.

107
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:15,238
We gave three heavy-hearted cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic.
