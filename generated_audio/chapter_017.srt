00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,292
Chapter 17.

2
00:00:01,332 --> 00:00:02,673
The Ramadan.

3
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:27,557
As Queequeg's Ramadan, or fasting and humiliation, was to continue all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards nightfall, for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toadstool, or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,

4
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:39,548
who, with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.

5
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:53,882
I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals, pagans, and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects.

6
00:00:54,098 --> 00:01:00,005
There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan.

7
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:01,387
But what of that?

8
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:04,891
Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose.

9
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:08,074
He seemed to be content, and there let him rest.

10
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,038
All our arguing with him would not avail.

11
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,943
Let him be, I say, and heaven have mercy on us all.

12
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:22,992
Presbyterians and pagans alike, for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending.

13
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:31,711
Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door, but no answer.

14
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:34,715
I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.

15
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:39,059
Kwekwek, said I softly through the keyhole, all silent.

16
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,001
I say, Kwekwek, why don't you speak?

17
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:42,363
It's I, Ishmael.

18
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,645
But all remained still as before.

19
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:46,507
I began to grow alarmed.

20
00:01:47,228 --> 00:01:48,990
I had allowed him such abundant time.

21
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,713
I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.

22
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:55,479
I looked through the keyhole, but the door opening into an odd corner of the room.

23
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,605
The keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one.

24
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:03,433
I could only see part of the footboard of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more.

25
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:14,832
I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber.

26
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:25,144
That's strange, thought I. But at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.

27
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:26,706
Kwee-kweg!

28
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:27,466
Kwee-kweg!

29
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:28,508
All still.

30
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:30,190
Something must have happened.

31
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,571
Apoplexy!

32
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:35,055
I tried to burst open the door, but it stubbornly resisted.

33
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:39,580
Running downstairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met.

34
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:41,022
The chambermaid.

35
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,077
She cried, I thought something must be the matter.

36
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:50,348
I went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard.

37
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:52,853
And it's been just so silent ever since.

38
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:58,825
But I thought maybe you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safekeeping.

39
00:02:59,058 --> 00:02:59,418
Law!

40
00:02:59,679 --> 00:02:59,979
Law!

41
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:00,380
Ma'am!

42
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,281
Mistress!

43
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:01,881
Murder!

44
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:02,743
Mrs. Hussey!

45
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:03,684
Apoplexy!"

46
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:07,969
And with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, eye following.

47
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:20,104
Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard pot in one hand and a vinegar cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the casters and scolding her little black boy meantime.

48
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:23,197
"'Woodhouse,' cried I, which way to it?

49
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,942
Run for God's sake, and fetch something to pry open the door.

50
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:28,584
The axe, the axe!

51
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:30,687
He's had a stroke, depend upon it."

52
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:42,583
And so saying I was unmethodically rushing upstairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard pot and vinegar cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.

53
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:44,045
"'What's the matter with you, young man?

54
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:45,046
Get the axe!

55
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:49,332
For God's sake, run for the doctor, someone, while I pry it open.'

56
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:54,892
"'Look here,' said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar cruet so as to have one hand free.

57
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:55,873
"'Look here!

58
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:58,597
Are you talking about prying open any of my doors?'

59
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:01,101
And with that she seized my arm.

60
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,003
"'What's the matter with you?

61
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:04,726
What's the matter with you, shipmate?'

62
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:11,235
In as calm but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the whole case.

63
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:21,102
Unconsciously clapping the vinegar cruet to one side of her nose, she ruminated for an instant, then exclaimed, no, I haven't seen it since I put it there.

64
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:29,374
Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing.

65
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,158
He's killed himself, she cried.

66
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:34,642
It's unfortnate Stig's done over again.

67
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:36,625
There goes another counterpane.

68
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:39,028
God pity his poor mother.

69
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,954
It will be the ruin of my house.

70
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:42,896
Has the poor lad a sister?

71
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:44,638
Where's that girl?

72
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:52,865
There, Betty, go to Snarls the painter and tell him to paint me a sign with, no suicides permitted here and no smoking in the parlor.

73
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:55,388
Might as well kill both birds at once.

74
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:56,629
Kill?

75
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:59,391
The Lord be merciful to his ghost.

76
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:00,953
What's that noise there?

77
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:03,375
You, young man, avast there.

78
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:08,880
And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door.

79
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,741
I don't allow it.

80
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:11,824
I won't have my premises spoiled.

81
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:13,366
Go for the locksmith.

82
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,048
There's one about a mile from here."

83
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:16,430
But avast!

84
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,332
Putting her hand in her side pocket.

85
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,615
Here's a key that'll fit, I guess.

86
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:21,416
Let's see.

87
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:23,999
And with that, she turned it in the lock.

88
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,161
But, alas!

89
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:28,926
Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.

90
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:38,698
Have to burst it open, said I, and was running down the entry a little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should not break down her premises.

91
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:43,790
But I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush, dashed myself full against the mark.

92
00:05:44,511 --> 00:06:00,653
With a prodigious noise, the door flew open, and the knob, slamming against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling, and there, good heavens, there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected, right in the middle of the room, squatting on his hams and holding Yojo on top of his head.

93
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:07,723
He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.

94
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:09,899
"'Queequeg,' said I, going up to him.

95
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,067
"'Queequeg, what's the matter with you?'

96
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:15,098
"'He hain't been a-sittin' so all day, has he?'

97
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:16,262
said the landlady."

98
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:19,167
but always said not a word could we drag out of him.

99
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:36,782
I almost felt like pushing him over so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained, especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going, too, without his regular meals.

100
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:46,030
Mrs. Hussey, said I, he's a-alive at all events, so leave us, if you please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.

101
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:52,455
Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair, but in vain.

102
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:57,823
There he sat, and all he could do, for all my polite arts and blandishments.

103
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:04,613
He would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the slightest way.

104
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:08,638
I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan.

105
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,362
Do they fast on their hams that way in his native island?

106
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:13,265
It must be so, yes.

107
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:15,949
It's part of his creed, I suppose.

108
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:17,411
Well then, let him rest.

109
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:19,314
He'll get up sooner or later, no doubt.

110
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:26,165
It can't last forever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year, and I don't believe it's very punctual then.

111
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:35,980
I went down to supper, after sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum pudding voyage, as they called it.

112
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:46,383
That is, a short whaling voyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only, after listening to these plum puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock.

113
00:07:46,984 --> 00:07:54,120
I went upstairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time, Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination.

114
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,984
But no, there he was, just where I had left him.

115
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,646
He had not stirred an inch.

116
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,090
I began to grow vexed with him.

117
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:09,661
It seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head.

118
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:13,346
For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself.

119
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:14,608
Get up and have some supper.

120
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:15,589
You'll starve.

121
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,492
You'll kill yourself, Queequeg.

122
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:19,299
but not a word did he reply.

123
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:27,516
Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep, and no doubt before a great while he would follow me.

124
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:38,537
But previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night, and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on.

125
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:42,886
For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze.

126
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:48,238
I had blown out the candle and the mere thought of Queequeg, not four feet off.

127
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:54,014
Sitting there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark, this made me really wretched.

128
00:08:54,034 --> 00:09:01,368
Think of it, sleeping all night in the same room with a wide-awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan.

129
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:11,627
But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of day, when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had been screwed down to the floor.

130
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:23,733
But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look, limped towards me where I lay, pressed his forehead again against mine, and said his Ramadan was over.

131
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:37,004
Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it also.

132
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:40,247
But when a man's religion becomes really frantic,

133
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:51,907
when it is a positive torment to him and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in, then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him.

134
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:54,812
And just so I now did with Queequeg.

135
00:09:55,673 --> 00:09:59,560
Queequeg, said I, get into bed now and lie and listen to me.

136
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:04,328
I then went on, beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions.

137
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:24,747
and coming down to the various religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense, bad for the health, useless for the soul, opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense.

138
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:38,742
I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.

139
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:50,515
Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in, hence the spirit caves in, and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.

140
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:56,710
This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters.

141
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:08,982
In one word, Queequeg, said I rather digressively, hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple dumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.

142
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:16,628
I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia, expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in.

143
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:20,552
He said no, only upon one memorable occasion.

144
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:32,921
It was after a great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.

145
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:36,308
No more, Queequeg, said I, shuddering.

146
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:40,937
That will do, for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them.

147
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:51,739
I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor.

148
00:11:52,079 --> 00:12:05,575
And then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a palau, with breadfruit and coconuts, and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends.

149
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,659
just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.
