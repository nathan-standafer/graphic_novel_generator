00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:15,222
CHAPTER XVII THE RAMADAN As Queen Quig's Ramadan, or fasting and humiliation, was to continue all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards nightfall, for I cherished the greatest respect towards everybody's religious obligations, never mind how comical.

2
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:31,607
and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toadstool for other creatures in certain parts of our earth, who, with a degree of fruitmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of a deceased landed appropriator merely in a

3
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:46,802
I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals, pagans, and whatnot, because of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects.

4
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:53,949
There was Queequeg now, certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadanin, but what of that?

5
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:57,493
Queequeg thought he knew what he was about.

6
00:00:57,473 --> 00:01:02,379
I suppose," seemed to be content, and there let him rest.

7
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,403
All our arguing with him would not avail let him be.

8
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:17,018
I say Colonel and Heaven have mercy on us all Presbyterians and pagans alike, for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.

9
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:26,152
Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door, but no answer.

10
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:29,538
I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.

11
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:34,566
"'Kwee Kweg,' said I softly through the key, whole to all silent.

12
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:37,650
"'I say, Kwee Kweg, why don't you speak?

13
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:39,293
It's I, Ishmael.'

14
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,071
but all remained still as before.

15
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,133
I began to grow alarmed.

16
00:01:44,674 --> 00:01:46,736
I had allowed him such abundant time.

17
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:49,659
I thought he might have had an epiplectic fit.

18
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:54,423
I looked through the keyhole, but the door opening into an odd corner of the room.

19
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:58,788
The keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one.

20
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:05,955
I could only see part of the footboard of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more.

21
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:18,988
I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the landlady the evening previewed had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber.

22
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:31,200
That's strange, thought I, but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.

23
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,468
All still.

24
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,112
Something must have happened.

25
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:37,355
Apoplexy.

26
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:40,643
I tried to burst open the door, but it stubbornly resisted.

27
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:46,658
Running downstairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met the chambermaid.

28
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:48,826
La, la!"

29
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:49,428
she cried.

30
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:51,753
I thought something must be the matter.

31
00:02:51,813 --> 00:03:00,713
I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was locked, and not a mouse to be heard, and it's been just so silent ever since.

32
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:06,486
But I thought, maybe, you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safekeeping.

33
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:11,297
La, la, ma'am, Mistress Murder, Mrs.

34
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:11,858
Hussey."

35
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:12,899
"'Apoplexy!'

36
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,304
and with these cries she ran towards the kitchen, eye following.

37
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:30,820
Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard pot in one hand and a vinegar cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the casters and scolding her little black boy meantime.

38
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:34,702
"'Woodhouse,' cried I, which way to it?

39
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:38,206
Run, for God's sake, and fetch something to pry open the door.

40
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:40,189
The axe, the axe!

41
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,771
He's had a stroke.

42
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:42,952
Depend upon it."

43
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:55,609
Ans, and so saying, I was unmethodically rushing upstairs again, empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard pot and vinegar cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.

44
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:58,052
What's the matter with you, young man?

45
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,795
Get the axe.

46
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:04,181
For God's sake, run for the doctor, someone, while I pry it open."

47
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:11,651
"'Look here,' said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar cruet, so as to have one hand free.

48
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:13,113
"'Look here.

49
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:16,397
Are you talking about prying open any of my doors?'

50
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,241
And with that she seized my arm.

51
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:20,363
"'What's the matter with you?

52
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:22,626
What's the matter with you, shipmate?'

53
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:29,263
In as calm but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the whole case.

54
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:35,569
Unconsciously clapping the vinegar crouet to one side of her nose, she ruminated for an instant.

55
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,094
Then exclaimed, No, I haven't seen it since I put it there.

56
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:51,043
Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing.

57
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:53,549
"'He's killed himself,' she cried.

58
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,337
"'It's unfortunate Stig's done over again.

59
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,402
There goes another counterpane.

60
00:04:58,943 --> 00:05:00,487
God pity his poor mother!

61
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:02,753
It will be the ruin of my house.

62
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:04,939
Has the poor lad a sister?'

63
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:05,901
Where's that girl?

64
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:07,024
Good.

65
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:19,981
There, Betty, go to Schnoll's, the painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with no suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlour, and might as well kill both birds at once."

66
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:20,341
"'Kill!

67
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:22,544
The Lord be merciful to his ghost!

68
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:24,246
What's that noise there?

69
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:26,429
You, young man, avast there!'

70
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,155
And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door.

71
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,589
I don't allow it.

72
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,013
I won't have my premises spoiled.

73
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:39,438
Go for the locksmith, there is one about a mile from here.

74
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,224
But I've asked, putting her hand in her side pocket.

75
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:46,389
Here's the key that'll fit, I guess, let's see."

76
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:50,055
And with that she turned it in the lock-butt.

77
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:50,656
Alas!

78
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:54,724
Kwee Kweg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.

79
00:05:55,025 --> 00:06:13,039
Half to burst it open, said I, and was running down the entry a little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should not break down her premises, but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.

80
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:22,854
With a prodigious noise, the door flew open, and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling, and there, good heavens!

81
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:32,648
There sat Kwekweg, altogether cool and self-collected, right in the middle of the room, squatting on his hams and holding Yojo on top of his head.

82
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:41,001
He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.

83
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,205
"'Creekwag,' said I, going up to him.

84
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:46,671
"'Creekwag, what's the matter with you?'

85
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:50,360
"'He hain't been a-sittin' so all day, has he?'

86
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:51,443
said the landlady.

87
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:52,525
All we said.

88
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,112
Not a word could we drag out of him.

89
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:57,758
I almost felt like pushing him over.

90
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:14,925
so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained, especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going to without his regular meals.

91
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:15,346
"'Mrs.

92
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:24,640
Hussey,' said I, "'he's all live at all events, so leave us, if you please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.'"

93
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:31,508
Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Kwekwe to take a chair, but in vain.

94
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:44,809
There he sat, and all he could do, for all my polite arts and blandishments, he would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the slightest way.

95
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,815
I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan.

96
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:54,099
Do they fast on their hands that way, in his native island?

97
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,521
It must be so.

98
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,385
Yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose.

99
00:07:59,365 --> 00:08:02,590
Let him rest hell-get-up sooner or later, no doubt."

100
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:10,522
It can't last for ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year, and I don't believe it's very punctual.

101
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:12,745
Then I went down to supper.

102
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:27,347
After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it Thoth is, a short wailing voyage in a schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line,

103
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:33,423
in the Atlantic Ocean only, after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock.

104
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:42,687
I went upstairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination."

105
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:46,051
But no, there he was, just where I had left him.

106
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,034
He had not stirred an inch.

107
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:50,497
I began to grow vexed with him.

108
00:08:51,018 --> 00:09:01,231
It seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day, and half the night on his hams, in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head.

109
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:04,295
For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself.

110
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:05,877
Get up and have some supper.

111
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:07,158
You'll starve.

112
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:09,461
You'll kill yourself, Queequeg."

113
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:12,505
But not a word did he reply.

114
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:21,179
Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep, and, no doubt, before a great while he would follow me.

115
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:34,138
But previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him, as it promised to be a very cold night, and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on.

116
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:39,068
For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze.

117
00:09:39,388 --> 00:09:52,313
I had blown out the candle, and the mere thought of Queequeg not four feet off sitting there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark, this made me really wretched.

118
00:09:52,293 --> 00:10:00,028
Think of it, sleeping all night in the same room, with a wide-awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan.

119
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:13,474
But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of day, when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had been screwed down to the floor.

120
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:29,783
But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look, lit towards me where I lay, pressed his forehead again against mine, and said his Ramadan was over.

121
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:36,255
Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's religion, be it what it may,

122
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:43,990
so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it also.

123
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:55,493
But when a man's religion becomes really frantic, when it is a positive torment to him, and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in,

124
00:10:55,473 --> 00:11:03,319
Then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him, and just so I now did with Queequeg.

125
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:08,335
"'Queequeg,' said I, get into bed now, and lie and listen to me."

126
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:36,853
I then went on, beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various religions at the present time, during which time I labored to show quick-quake that all these lengths, ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense, bad for the health, useless for the soul, deprossed, in short, to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense.

127
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:51,316
I told him, too, that, he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.

128
00:11:51,456 --> 00:12:01,913
Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave, and hence the spirit caves in, and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.

129
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:09,185
This is the reason why most dyspectic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters.

130
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:23,007
In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively, hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple dumpling, and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans,

131
00:12:22,987 --> 00:12:31,620
I then asked Kwek-Kwek whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia, expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in.

132
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,907
He said, no, only upon one memorable occasion.

133
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:48,066
It was after a great feast given by his father the King on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the afternoon

134
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:51,152
and all cooked and eaten that very evening.

135
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:59,629
"'No more, Queequeg,' said I, shuddering, that will do, for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them.

136
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:07,084
I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom when a great battle had been gained there.

137
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:29,224
to barbeque all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor, and then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with bread-fruit and coconuts, and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.

138
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:54,233
After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg, because, in the first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own point of view, and, in the second place, he did not more than one-third understand me, couched my ideas simply as I would, and, finally,

139
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:59,099
He no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did.

140
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:13,318
He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.

141
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:32,775
At last we rose and dressed and quickly, taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.
