00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:22,225
CHAPTER XVI THE SHIP In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow, but, to my surprise and no small concern, Kwee Kweg now gave me to understand that he had been diligently consulting Yojo the name of his black little god, and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it every way, that instead of our going together among the wailing fleet and harbor

2
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:42,525
and in concert selecting our craft, and say, in sad of this I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined, that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo's purpose befriending us, in order to do so, had already to do, at all pitched—I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yoho's judgment,

3
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:58,270
and surprising forecast of things, and cherished Yoho with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.

4
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:06,344
Now, this plan of Kweehteg's, or rather Yo-Yo's, touching the selection of our craft, I did not like that plan at all.

5
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:14,959
I had not a little relied upon Kweehteg's sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.

6
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:32,577
But, as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce, and accordingly prepared to set about this business, with a determined, rushing sort of energy and vigour that should quickly settle that trifling little affair.

7
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:44,630
Next morning early, leaving Queequeg, shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom, for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation and prayer, with Queequeg and Yojo that day.

8
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,932
It was, I never could find out.

9
00:01:47,493 --> 00:02:01,888
For, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and twenty-six articles leaving Queejaig, then fasting on his tomahawk pike, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings I sallied out among the shipping.

10
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:14,283
After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three years' voyages—the Devildam, the Titbit, and the Pequod.

11
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:24,274
Devildam—I do not know the origin of Titbit, as obvious Pequod, you will no doubt remember—was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians.

12
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:27,538
Now, extinct as the ancient Medes,

13
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:41,377
I peered and pried about the devil-dam from her, hopped over to the tit-bit, and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.

14
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:54,235
You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught, I know, square-toed luggers, mountainous Japanese junks, butterbucks, galeots, and whatnot not perit,

15
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:58,642
You never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Piquad.

16
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:06,874
She was a ship of the old school, rather small, if anything, with an old-fashioned, claw-footed look about her.

17
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:20,475
Long-seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was darkened like a French grenadier's, who has unlike fought in Egypt and Siberia.

18
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:29,187
her venerable bows looked bearded, her masts cut somewhere on the coast of Japan where her original ones were lost overboard.

19
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:35,816
In a gale her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne.

20
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:45,028
Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrim-worshipped flagstone in Canterbury Cathedral where Beckett bled.

21
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:56,565
But to all these her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed.

22
00:03:56,805 --> 00:04:11,286
Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod, this old Peleg, during the term of his chief mateship,

23
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:25,303
had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkell Hakes, carved buckler or bedstead.

24
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:33,333
She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.

25
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:41,222
She was a thing of trochees, a cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies.

26
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:54,756
All round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm-whale inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen-thoos and tendons to.

27
00:04:55,296 --> 00:05:05,607
Those stews ran not through base blocks of land-wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory, scorning a turnstile-wheel at her reverent helm,

28
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:14,459
She sported there a tiller, and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long, narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.

29
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:23,390
The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.

30
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:27,696
A noble craft, but somehow most melancholy.

31
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:30,700
All noble things are touched with that.

32
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:49,448
Now, when I looked about the quarter-deck for someone having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody, but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.

33
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:52,692
It seemed only a temporary erection used in port.

34
00:05:53,493 --> 00:06:04,928
It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high, consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone, taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right whale.

35
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:19,266
Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose, hairy fibres waved to and fro

36
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:23,163
like the topknot on some old Potawatomi Satyam's head.

37
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:26,758
A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship.

38
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:31,577
so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.

39
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:46,920
And, half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority, and due, its being noon and the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command.

40
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,265
He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair

41
00:06:50,245 --> 00:07:01,748
riddling all over with curious carving, and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.

42
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:06,718
There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw.

43
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:14,425
He was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style.

44
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:31,660
Only there was a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward for, for this causes, the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together.

45
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,883
Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in the scowl.

46
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:37,549
"'Is this the captain of the Pequod?'

47
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,794
said I, advancing to the door of the tent.

48
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:44,524
"'Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?'

49
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,667
he demanded.

50
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,691
"'I was thinking of shipping.'"

51
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:50,480
Thou wast, wast thou?

52
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:51,502
I see thou art.

53
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,906
No non-Tucketer ever been in a stove-boat.

54
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,130
No, sir, I never have.

55
00:07:57,091 --> 00:08:00,096
Just know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say ye.

56
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:01,839
Nothing, sir.

57
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,483
But I have no doubt I shall soon learn.

58
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:08,650
I've been several voyages in the merchant's service, and I think that

59
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:11,404
Merchant's service, be damned!

60
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:13,327
Talk not that lingo to me.

61
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:15,110
Dost see that leg?

62
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:21,359
I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talk'st of the merchant's service to me again.

63
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,782
Merchant's service, indeed!

64
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:28,629
I suppose thou only feel considerable proud of having served in those merchant-ships.

65
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,672
But flukes!

66
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:33,137
Man, what makes thee want to go a-wailing?

67
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,924
Ay, ay, looks a little suspicious, don't it?

68
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:40,371
Ay, hast not been a pirate, hast thou?

69
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:43,778
Didst not rob thy last captain, didst thou?

70
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,247
Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gittest sea?

71
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,972
I protested my innocence of these things.

72
00:08:50,952 --> 00:09:06,723
I saw that under the mask of these half-humorous innuendos this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish nantuckter, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.

73
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,070
But what takes thee, O Wheeling?

74
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,555
I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.

75
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,813
Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.

76
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,455
I want to see the world.

77
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:20,198
Want to see what whaling is, eh?

78
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,762
Have ye clapped aye on Captain Ahab?

79
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,985
Who is Captain Ahab, sir?

80
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:27,808
Aye, aye, I thought so.

81
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:30,952
Captain Ahab is the captain of this ship.

82
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,115
I am mistaken, then.

83
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:35,758
I thought I was speaking to the captain himself.

84
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:38,738
Thou art speaking to Captain Pellig.

85
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,344
That's who ye are speaking to, young man.

86
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:49,482
It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew.

87
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:52,549
We are part owners and agents.

88
00:09:52,529 --> 00:10:04,717
But, as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before you bind yourself to it, past backing out.

89
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,791
Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.

90
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:12,073
What do you mean, sir?"

91
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:14,517
Was the other one lost by a whale.

92
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,601
Lost by a whale!

93
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:18,825
Young man, come nearer to me!

94
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:24,995
It was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmigiani that ever chipped a boat.

95
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:25,636
Ah!

96
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:26,177
Ah!

97
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:34,551
I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation.

98
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:40,356
but said as calmly as I could,— "'What you say is, no doubt, true enough, sir.

99
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:46,001
But how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale?

100
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:50,746
Though, indeed, I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.

101
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:54,889
Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft.

102
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,632
D'ye say thou dost not talk shark a bit?'

103
00:10:58,633 --> 00:10:59,033
"'Sure.

104
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:00,715
Eve been to sea before now.

105
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:01,836
Sure of that?'

106
00:11:01,856 --> 00:11:04,538
"'Sir,' said I.

107
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:07,782
I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant.

108
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:09,865
Hard down out of that.

109
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:12,348
Mind what I said about the merchant's service.

110
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:13,550
Don't aggravate me.

111
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,591
I won't have it.

112
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:16,855
But let us understand each other.

113
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,979
I have given thee a hint about what whaling is.

114
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:22,682
Do yet feel inclined for it.

115
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,044
I do, sir.

116
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:25,686
Very good.

117
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:29,952
Now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale's throat,

118
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:31,473
and then jump after it?

119
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:33,935
Answer quick."

120
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:39,780
I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so, not to be got rid of.

121
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:41,902
That is, I don't take to be the fact.

122
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,163
Good again.

123
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:52,471
Now then, thou not only want'st to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world?"

124
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:54,433
Was not that what he said?

125
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:56,195
I thought so.

126
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:58,977
Well, then, just step forward there.

127
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:04,005
And take a peep over the weather-bough, and then back to me, and tell me what ye see there."

128
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:14,737
For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.

129
00:12:15,238 --> 00:12:21,487
But concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.

130
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:33,385
Going forward and glancing over the weather-bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean.

131
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:40,156
The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous, and forbidding not the slightest variety that I could see.

132
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:43,522
"'Well, what's the report?'

133
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,506
said Pallag when I came back.

134
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:46,447
"'What did you see?'

135
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,370
"'Not much,' I replied.

136
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,636
"'Nothing but water considerable horizon, though.

137
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:54,681
And there's a squall coming up, I think.'

138
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,625
Well, what dost thou think, then, of seeing the world?

139
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,411
Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?

140
00:13:04,353 --> 00:13:06,335
Can't ye see the world where you stand?"

141
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:17,831
I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling, I must, and I would, and the Pequod was as good a ship as any I thought the best, and all this I now repeated to Peleg.

142
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:22,076
Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.

143
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:25,461
And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off.

144
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:31,847
he added, come along with ye, and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin.

145
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:38,192
Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure.

146
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:55,448
It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who, along with Captain Peleg, was one of the largest owners of the vessels, the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants, widows, fatherless children, and chancery-wards

147
00:13:55,428 --> 00:14:03,399
and cash owning about the value of a timberhead, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship.

148
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:13,453
People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.

149
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:30,177
Now Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect, and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker

150
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:35,743
only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.

151
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:41,608
For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters.

152
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:43,590
They are fighting Quakers.

153
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:46,633
They are Quakers with a vengeance.

154
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:59,286
So that there are instances among them of men who, named with Scripture, names a singularly common fashion on the island and in childhood, naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom.

155
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:16,248
Still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king or a poetical pagan Roman.

156
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:28,024
And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart, who, as also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters

157
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:46,401
and beneath constellations never seen here at the North, Bin led to think untraditionally and independently and independently, or sieving all Nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language.

158
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:58,866
Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half-wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature.

159
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:04,558
For all men tragically great are made, so through a certain morbidness.

160
00:16:04,538 --> 00:16:06,340
Be sure of this, O young ambition.

161
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,844
All moral greatness is but disease.

162
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:24,403
But, as yet, we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another, and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.

163
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:29,550
Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.

164
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:56,483
But, unlike Captain Peleg, who cared not a rash for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things, the veriest of all trifles, Captain Bildad, had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad lovely island creatures round the Hornall that had not moved this native-born Quaker one single jot,

165
00:16:56,463 --> 00:17:06,702
had not so much as altered one angle of his vest, still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg.

166
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:12,312
Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders,

167
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:29,457
Yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific, and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat spilled tons upon tons of Leviathan gore, how now, in the contemplative evening of his days,

168
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:35,323
The pious Bildad reconciled these things in a reminiscence, I do not know but.

169
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:48,116
It did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.

170
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:58,667
This world pays dividends, rising from a little cabin boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat,

171
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:19,086
From that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship-owner, Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.

172
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:29,673
Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days a bitter, hard taskmaster.

173
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:40,011
They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Cadigut whalemen, his crew, upon arriving home,

174
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:45,177
were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore, exhausted, and worn out.

175
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:51,484
For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least.

176
00:18:52,345 --> 00:19:02,337
He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said, but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them.

177
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:19,752
When Bildad was a chief mate, to have his drab, colored eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch something, a hammer or a marling spike, and go to work like mad at something or other, never mind what.

178
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,177
Indolence and idleness perished before him.

179
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:27,106
His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character.

180
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:39,107
On his long, gaunt body he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.

181
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:46,024
Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Pellag down into the cabin.

182
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:58,102
The space between the decks was small, and there, bolt upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coattails.

183
00:19:58,122 --> 00:20:07,575
His broad brim was placed beside him, his legs were stiffly crossed, his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin, and spectacles on nose.

184
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:37,562
He seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.

185
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:40,866
"'He says he's our man, Bildad,' said Peleg.

186
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:42,849
He wants to ship."

187
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:43,490
"'Dust thee?'

188
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:52,983
said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me, "'U-u-u-u—' "'I dust,' said I unconsciously.

189
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:54,765
He was so intense a Quaker."

190
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:57,128
"'What do you think of him, Bildad?'

191
00:20:57,148 --> 00:20:58,470
said Peleg.

192
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,437
He'll do," said Bildad I and me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.

193
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:11,589
I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.

194
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,836
But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply.

195
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:25,690
Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table.

196
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:33,495
I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage.

197
00:21:33,935 --> 00:21:53,736
I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages, but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's company.

198
00:21:53,716 --> 00:22:20,618
I was also aware that, being a green-handed whaling, my own lay would not be very large, but, considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the two hundred and seventy-fifth lay—that is, the two hundred and seventy-fifth part—of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to.

199
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:40,681
And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better than nothing, and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiva.

200
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:46,568
It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune, and so it was.

201
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:48,951
A very poor way, indeed.

202
00:22:48,931 --> 00:23:02,551
But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the thundercloud.

203
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:15,850
Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.

204
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:24,480
But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits, was this écharée.

205
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:44,824
I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad, how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.

206
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:51,271
And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping-hands.

207
00:23:51,911 --> 00:24:12,533
Now, while Pallack was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings, Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book,—'Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where, moth?'

208
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,597
"'Well, Captain Buland,' interrupted Peleg, "'what d'ye say?

209
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:20,102
What lay shall we give this young man?'

210
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:23,748
"'Thou knowest best,' was the sepulchral reply.

211
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,736
"'The seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?

212
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:32,445
"'Where moth and rust do corrupt, but lay, despunk.'

213
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:34,268
"'Lay, indeed,' thought I.

214
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:37,901
In such a lay, the seven hundred seventy-seventh.

215
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:46,971
Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not lay up many lays here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.

216
00:24:47,192 --> 00:25:02,449
It was an exceedingly long lay, that, indeed, and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that those seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number.

217
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:14,357
Yet, when you come to make a teenth of it, you will then see, I say, that the 777th part of a farthing is a good deal less than 777 gold doubloons.

218
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,805
And I thought at the time, why,

219
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:20,870
"'Blast your eyes, Bildad,' cried Peleg.

220
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,875
"'Thou dost not want to swindle this young man.

221
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:25,657
He must have more than that.'"

222
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:36,334
"'Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,' again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes, and then went on mumbling for where your treasure is, "'There will your heart be also.'"

223
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,277
I am going to put him down for the three hundredth," said Peleg.

224
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:43,521
Do ye hear that, Bildad?

225
00:25:43,901 --> 00:25:46,165
The three hundredth lay, I say.

226
00:25:46,225 --> 00:26:00,972
Bildad laid down his book, and, turning solemnly towards him, said, Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart, but thou must consider the duty thou ow'st to the other owners of this ship, widows and orphans.

227
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:14,640
Many of them, and that if we, too, abundantly reward the labours of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans.

228
00:26:15,768 --> 00:26:20,434
"'Thou Bildad,' roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin.

229
00:26:20,494 --> 00:26:35,174
"'Last ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough, the founder, the largest ship that ever sailed, round Cape Horn.'"

230
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:43,024
"'Captain Peleg,' said Bildad steadily, "'thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell.

231
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:55,857
But as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one, and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.

232
00:26:56,978 --> 00:26:57,739
Fiery pit!

233
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:58,760
fiery pit!

234
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,941
ye insult me!

235
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:00,902
Man!

236
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:03,925
past all natural bearing, ye insult me!

237
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:08,269
It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he's bound to hell.

238
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:25,245
Flukes and flings, Bill Dad, say that again to me, And start my soul-bolts, but I'll, I'll, Yes, I'll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on, Out of the cabin, ye canting drab-coloured son Of a wooden gunner straight weak with ye.

239
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:34,757
As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.

240
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:49,917
Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded,

241
00:27:49,897 --> 00:27:59,793
I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg.

242
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:08,508
But, to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing.

243
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:13,035
He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways.

244
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:25,193
As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little, as if still nervously agitated.

245
00:28:25,213 --> 00:28:27,135
"'Phew!'

246
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:28,957
he whistled at last.

247
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:31,480
The squaw's gone off to leeward, I think.

248
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,943
"'Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance.

249
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:36,805
Mend that pen, will ye?

250
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:39,408
My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.

251
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,389
That's he.

252
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:42,651
Thank ye, Bildad.

253
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:46,357
Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say?

254
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:50,563
Well, then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay."

255
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:56,031
"'Captain Peleg,' said I, "'I have a friend with me who wants to ship too.

256
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:57,954
Shall I bring him down to-morrow?'

257
00:28:57,974 --> 00:29:00,718
"'To be sure,' said Peleg.

258
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:03,082
"'Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.

259
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,085
What lay does he want?'

260
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:09,972
groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.

261
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:14,505
Oh, never thee mind about that, Bildad," said Peleg.

262
00:29:15,446 --> 00:29:17,968
Has he ever wailed at any, turning to me?

263
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:20,831
Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.

264
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:23,974
Well, bring him along, then.

265
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:38,389
And, after signing the papers, off I went, nothing doubting, but that I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.

266
00:29:38,808 --> 00:30:08,663
But I had not proceeded far when I began to bethink me that the captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me, though indeed in many cases a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command, for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore-intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concern of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in

267
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:15,675
However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands."

268
00:30:15,695 --> 00:30:21,324
Turning back, I accosted Captain Pellig, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.

269
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:24,450
"'And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?

270
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:25,872
It's all right enough.

271
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:27,575
Thou art chipped.'

272
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:29,959
"'Yes, but I should like to see him.'

273
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:34,524
But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.

274
00:30:34,544 --> 00:30:42,441
I don't know exactly what's the matter with him, but he keeps close inside the house, ah, sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.

275
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:46,530
In fact, he ain't sick, but no, he isn't well either."

276
00:30:47,253 --> 00:30:52,340
Now, young man, he won't always see me, so I don't suppose he will leave.

277
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:56,245
He's a queer man, Captain Ahab, so some think but a good one.

278
00:30:57,027 --> 00:30:58,469
Oh, thou'lt like him well enough.

279
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,311
No fear, no fear.

280
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:03,375
He's a grand, ungodly, godlike man.

281
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:08,923
Captain Ahab doesn't speak much, but when he does speak, then you may well listen."

282
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:29,646
Marquis, be forewarned, Ayabs above the common, Ayabs being in colleges, as well as among the cannibals, Being used to deeper wonders than the waves, Fix'd his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes Than whales, his lance, ay, the keenest and the surest, That out of all our isle, O!

283
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:40,077
He ain't Captain Bill Dead, no, And he ain't Captain Peleg Hayes, Ahab, But Ahab of old, thou know'st, was a crowned king, And a very vile one.

284
00:31:40,618 --> 00:31:44,983
When that wicked king was slain, The dogs, did they not lick his blood?"

285
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:50,709
"'Come hither to me, hither, hither,' Said Peleg, with a significance in his eye That almost startled me.

286
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:56,275
Look ye, lad, Never say that on board the Pequod, Never say it anywhere.

287
00:31:57,942 --> 00:32:06,258
Captain Ahab did not name himself, t'was a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelve-month-old.

288
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,289
And yet the old Squaw-Tistiget gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic.

289
00:32:14,092 --> 00:32:18,239
And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same.

290
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,363
I wish to warn thee.

291
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:21,385
It's a lie.

292
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:23,428
I know Captain Ahab well.

293
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:25,993
I've sailed with him as mate years ago.

294
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:27,275
I know what he is.

295
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:36,632
Good man, not a pious good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man, something like me, only there's a good deal more of him.

296
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:38,074
Ay, ay.

297
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:53,160
I know that he was never very jolly, and I know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell, but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see.

298
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:06,055
I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage, by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of moody, desperate moody, and savage sometimes, but that will all pass on.

299
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:14,845
And, once for all, let me tell thee, and assure thee, young man, it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one.

300
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:22,022
So good-bye to thee, and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name.

301
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:27,613
Besides, my boy, he has a wife, not three voyages, wedded a sweet, resigned girl.

302
00:33:28,295 --> 00:33:35,770
Think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child called, ye then, there can be any utter hopeless harm in Ahab.

303
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:41,217
No, no, my lad, stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities.

304
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:44,561
As I walked away I was full of thoughtfulness.

305
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:53,852
What had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.

306
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:58,438
And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him.

307
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:03,985
But for I don't know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.

308
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:13,725
And yet I also felt a strange awe of him, but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe, or I do not know what it was.

309
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:24,467
But I felt it, and it did not disincline me towards him, though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.

310
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:33,786
However, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.
