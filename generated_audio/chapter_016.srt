1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,252
Chapter 16.

2
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:02,374
The Ship.

3
00:00:03,235 --> 00:00:05,778
In bed we concocted our plans for the Marl.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:15,349
But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been diligently consulting Yojo, the name of his black little god.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:28,485
And Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it every way, that instead of our going together among the wailing fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft, instead of this, I say,

6
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:49,174
Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us, and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had—I have forgotten to mention that, in many things,

7
00:00:49,154 --> 00:01:06,320
Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising forecast of things, and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.

8
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:14,672
Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the selection of our craft, I did not like that plan at all.

9
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:35,710
I had not a little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely, but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair.

10
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:41,115
Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom,

11
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:49,607
For it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day.

12
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:50,969
H.O.W.

13
00:01:51,270 --> 00:02:00,623
It was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX articles.

14
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:10,291
Leaving Queequeg then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.

15
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:22,155
After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three years' voyages—the Devil Dam, the Titbit, and the Pequod.

16
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:36,577
Devil Dam, I do not know the origin of, T-I-T-B-I-T is obvious, P-E-Q-U-D, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians, now extinct as the ancient Metis.

17
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:48,615
I peered in pride about the Devil Dam from her, hopped over to the titbit, and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.

18
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:52,341
You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know.

19
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:58,190
Square-toed luggers, mountainous Japanese junks, butterbox galliots and whatnot.

20
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:04,360
But take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.

21
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,109
She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything, with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her.

22
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:21,586
Long-seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was darkened like a French grenadier's who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia.

23
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:24,270
Her venerable bows looked bearded.

24
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:31,360
Her masts cut somewhere on the coast of Japan where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale.

25
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:35,905
Her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne.

26
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:43,847
Her ancient decks were worn and wringled like the pilgrim-worshipped flagstone in Canterbury Cathedral where Beckett bled.

27
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:52,240
But to all these her old antiquities were added new and marvelous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed.

28
00:03:53,001 --> 00:04:01,954
Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman and one of the principal owners of the Pequod.

29
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:16,653
This old peleg, during the term of his chief mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except, it be, Thorkil Hakee's carved buckler or bedstead.

30
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:24,263
She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.

31
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:30,853
She was a thing of trophies, a cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies.

32
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:44,715
All round, her unpaneled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long, sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to.

33
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:51,064
Those thews ran not through base blocks of landwood, but deftly traveled over sheaves of sea ivory.

34
00:04:51,986 --> 00:05:02,822
Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller, and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long, narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.

35
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:10,334
The helmsman who's steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.

36
00:05:10,975 --> 00:05:14,461
A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy.

37
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,066
All noble things are touched with that.

38
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:24,338
Now when I looked about the quarterdeck, for someone having authority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,

39
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:32,108
At first I saw nobody, but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main mast.

40
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:35,332
It seemed only a temporary erection used in port.

41
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:46,647
It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high, consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right whale.

42
00:05:46,694 --> 00:06:02,018
Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose, hairy fibers waved to and fro like the topknot on some old Potawatomi sachem's head.

43
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,989
A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.

44
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:21,063
and half-concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority, and who, it being noon, and the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command.

45
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:33,458
He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving, and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.

46
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:38,364
There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw.

47
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:45,132
He was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot cloth cut in the Quaker style.

48
00:06:45,593 --> 00:07:01,150
Only there was a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to windward, for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together.

49
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,835
Such eye wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.

50
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:06,720
Is this the captain of the Pequod?

51
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,923
said I, advancing to the door of the tent.

52
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:12,830
Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?

53
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:13,772
he demanded.

54
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,236
I was thinking of shipping,

55
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:20,852
Thou wast, wast thou, I see thou art no Nantucketer, ever been in a stove-boat.

56
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:22,914
No, sir, I never have.

57
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:25,837
Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say.

58
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:26,757
Eh?

59
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:30,401
Nothing, sir, but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.

60
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:36,646
I've been several voyages in the merchant's service, and I think that... Merchant's service be damned.

61
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:38,728
Talk not that lingo to me.

62
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:40,189
Dost see that leg?

63
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:46,375
I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the merchant's service to me again.

64
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:48,278
Marchant service indeed!

65
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:53,266
I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships.

66
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:54,367
But, flukes!

67
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:57,452
Man, what makes thee want to go a-whaling, eh?

68
00:07:58,153 --> 00:08:00,096
It looks a little suspicious, don't it, eh?

69
00:08:00,877 --> 00:08:02,620
Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?

70
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,304
Didst not rob thy last captain, didst thou?

71
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:08,950
Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou get'st to sea?

72
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:12,295
I protested my innocence of these things.

73
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:27,365
I saw that under the mask of these half-humorous innuendos, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices and rather distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.

74
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:30,410
But what takes thee a whaling?

75
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,777
I want to know that before I think of shippingy.

76
00:08:34,077 --> 00:08:36,462
Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.

77
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:38,206
I want to see the world.

78
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:39,789
Want to see the world.

79
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,633
Want to see what whaling is, eh?

80
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:44,539
Have ye clapped aye on Captain Ahab?

81
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:46,964
Who is Captain Ahab, sir?

82
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,229
Aye, aye, I thought so.

83
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:52,035
Captain Ahab is the captain of this ship.

84
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,781
I am mistaken then.

85
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:56,645
I thought I was speaking to the captain himself.

86
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,468
Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg.

87
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,811
That's who ye are speaking to, young man.

88
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:10,322
It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs, including crew.

89
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,045
We are part owners and agents.

90
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:23,721
But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out.

91
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:29,009
Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.

92
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,591
What do you mean, sir?

93
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:32,554
Was the other one lost by a whale?

94
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:36,480
Lost by a whale, young man, come nearer to me.

95
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,188
It was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmaceti that ever chipped a boat.

96
00:09:44,446 --> 00:10:04,378
I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, What you say is no doubt true enough, sir, but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.

97
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,921
Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, D.C.

98
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,066
Thou dost not talk shark a bit.

99
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:15,336
Siree, ye've been to sea before now, sure of that.

100
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,591
Sir, said I, I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant.

101
00:10:22,043 --> 00:10:23,106
Hard down out of that.

102
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,612
Mind what I said about the marching service.

103
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:26,916
Don't aggravate me.

104
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:27,899
I won't have it.

105
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,884
But let us understand each other.

106
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,972
I have given thee a hint about what whaling is.

107
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:35,358
Do ye yet feel inclined for it?

108
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,504
I do, sir.

109
00:10:37,484 --> 00:10:38,226
Very good.

110
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:44,038
Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale's throat and then jump after it?

111
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,701
Answer, quick.

112
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:54,600
I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so, not to be got rid of, that is, which I don't take to be the fact.

113
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:56,404
Good again.

114
00:10:56,384 --> 00:11:04,856
Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world.

115
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:06,639
Was not that what ye said?

116
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,861
I thought so.

117
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:14,250
Well then, just step forward there and take a peep over the weatherbow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.

118
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:22,662
For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.

119
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,067
But concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.

120
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:37,160
Going forward and glancing over the weatherbow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood tide was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean.

121
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:44,430
The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding, not the slightest variety that I could see.

122
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,722
Well, what's the report?"

123
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:47,327
said Peleg when I came back.

124
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:48,410
What did ye see?

125
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,396
Not much, I replied.

126
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:55,652
Nothing but water, considerable horizon, though, and there's a squall coming up, I think.

127
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,321
Well, what dost thou think then of seeing the world?

128
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:01,704
Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?

129
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:04,547
Can't ye see the world where ye stand?

130
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:07,429
I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling.

131
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:11,373
I must, and I would, and the Pequod was as good a ship as any.

132
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:15,957
I thought the best, and all this I now repeated to Peleg.

133
00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:20,221
Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.

134
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:24,104
And now mayest as well sign the papers right off, he added.

135
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:25,926
Come along with ye.

136
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:29,371
And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cavern.

137
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:34,698
Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure.

138
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:40,506
It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel.

139
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:54,765
The other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants, widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards, each owning about the value of a timberhead, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship.

140
00:12:54,745 --> 00:13:02,393
People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours and approve state stocks bringing in good interest.

141
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:06,995
Now Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker.

142
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:22,100
The island having been originally settled by that sect, and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.

143
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:28,009
For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale hunters.

144
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:29,313
They are fighting Quakers.

145
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:40,463
They are Quakers with a vengeance, so that there are instances among them of men who, named with scripture names, a singularly common fashion on the island,

146
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:46,356
and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom.

147
00:13:46,977 --> 00:14:03,801
Still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea king or a poetical pagan Roman,

148
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:33,788
And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart, who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the North, been led to think untraditionally and independently, receiving all nature's sweet or savage impressions, fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly,

149
00:14:33,768 --> 00:14:39,498
but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language.

150
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,904
That man makes one in a whole nation's census.

151
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:54,865
Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half-wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature.

152
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:58,712
For all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness.

153
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:03,701
Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.

154
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:17,967
But, as yet, we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another, and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.

155
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:32,901
Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman, but unlike Captain Peleg who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things, the veriest of all trifles.

156
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:45,944
Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the horn.

157
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:53,171
All that had not moved this native-born Quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his vest.

158
00:15:53,831 --> 00:16:00,778
Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg.

159
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:16,901
Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific, and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat spilled tons upon tons of leviathan gore.

160
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:28,318
How now, in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know, but it did not seem to concern him much.

161
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:36,897
and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's religion is one thing and this practical world quite another.

162
00:16:36,937 --> 00:16:46,459
This world pays dividends, rising from a little cabin boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad, shad-bellied waistcoat.

163
00:16:46,439 --> 00:17:02,136
From that becoming boat header, chief mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner, Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of 60 and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.

164
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:12,548
Now Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter hard taskmaster.

165
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:25,204
They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Kattegat whalemen, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore-exhausted and worn out.

166
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:32,140
For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted to say the least.

167
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:40,174
He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said, but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them.

168
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:55,360
When Bildad was a chief mate, to have his drab-colored eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch something, a hammer or a marling spike, and go to work like mad at something or other, never mind what.

169
00:17:55,964 --> 00:17:58,327
indolence and idleness perished before him.

170
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:02,833
His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character.

171
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:13,806
On his long, gaunt body he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.

172
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:20,655
Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.

173
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:30,124
The space between the decks was small, and there bolt upright sat old Bildad who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coattails.

174
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:42,846
His broad brim was placed beside him, his legs were stiffly crossed, his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin, and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.

175
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:43,749
"'Bildad!'

176
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,290
cried Captain Peleg.

177
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,052
Added again, "'Bildad, eh?

178
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:52,216
Ye have been studying those scriptures now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge.

179
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:54,198
How far ye got, Bildad?'

180
00:18:54,959 --> 00:19:06,129
As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.

181
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:09,491
"'He says he's our man, Bildad,' said Peleg.

182
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:11,213
"'He wants to ship.

183
00:19:11,446 --> 00:19:14,857
"'Dust thee,' said Bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to me.

184
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:17,647
"'I dust,' said I unconsciously.

185
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,413
He was so intense a Quaker."

186
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:21,721
"'What do you think of him, Bildad?'

187
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:23,346
said Peleg."

188
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:30,057
"'He'll do,' said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.

189
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:37,769
I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.

190
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,994
But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply.

191
00:19:41,855 --> 00:19:49,266
Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table.

192
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:55,253
I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage.

193
00:19:56,054 --> 00:20:12,013
I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages, but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's company.

194
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:28,348
I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large, but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the two-seven-fifth lay.

195
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:34,077
That is, the two-seven-fifth part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to.

196
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:51,366
And though the two-hundred-seventy-fifth lay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better than nothing, and if we had a lucky voyage, my pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.

197
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:59,517
It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune, and so it was, a very poor way indeed.

198
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:10,152
But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the thundercloud.

199
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:21,263
Upon the whole I thought that the two hundred and seven-fifth lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the two hundredth, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.

200
00:21:21,944 --> 00:21:28,390
But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this.

201
00:21:28,842 --> 00:21:34,684
Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad.

202
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:46,050
how that, they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.

203
00:21:46,090 --> 00:22:00,992
And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside.

204
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:18,938
Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jackknife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings, Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth.

205
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:25,187
Well, Captain Bildad interrupted Peleg, What ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?

206
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:29,173
Thou knowest best, was the sepulchral reply.

207
00:22:29,322 --> 00:22:32,487
The 777th wouldn't be too much, would it?

208
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:35,572
Where moth and rust do corrupt, but lay.

209
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:39,999
Lay indeed, thought I, and such a lay, the 777th.

210
00:22:41,802 --> 00:22:50,555
Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not lay up many layep, many lays here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.

211
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:54,722
It was an exceedingly long lay that, indeed,

212
00:22:54,702 --> 00:23:15,395
And though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though 777 is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a teenth of it, you will then see, I say, that the 777th part of a farthing is a good deal less than 777 gold doubloons.

213
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:20,743
And so I thought at the time, Why blast your eyes, Bildad, cried Peleg.

214
00:23:20,723 --> 00:23:23,127
Thou dost not want to swindle this young man.

215
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:24,770
He must have more than that."

216
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:34,886
"'Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,' again said Bildad without lifting his eyes, and then went on mumbling, "'For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.'

217
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:38,793
"'I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,' said Peleg.

218
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:40,476
"'Do ye hear that, Bildad?

219
00:23:40,896 --> 00:23:43,120
The three hundredth lay, I say.'"

220
00:23:43,285 --> 00:24:04,101
Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him, said, Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart, but thou must consider the duty thou ow'st to the other owners of this ship, widows and orphans, many of them, and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans.

221
00:24:04,963 --> 00:24:08,449
The 777th lay, Captain Peleg.

222
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:13,194
"'Thou, Bildad,' roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin.

223
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:15,338
"'Blast ye, Captain Bildad.

224
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:25,137
If I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.'

225
00:24:25,157 --> 00:24:28,463
"'Captain Peleg,' said Bildad steadily.

226
00:24:28,443 --> 00:24:33,648
Thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell.

227
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:45,740
But as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one, and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.

228
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:47,321
FIERY PIT!

229
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:48,462
FIERY PIT!

230
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:51,846
Ye insult me, man, past all natural bearing.

231
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:54,829
Ye insult me, man, past all natural bearing.

232
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:56,290
Ye insult me.

233
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,915
It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he's bound to hell.

234
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,817
Flukes and flames.

235
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:14,009
Bildad, say that again to me and start my soulbolts, but I'll, I'll, I'll, yes, I'll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on.

236
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,353
Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-colored son of a wooden gun.

237
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:20,235
A straight wake with ye.

238
00:25:20,857 --> 00:25:23,722
As he thundered out this, he made a rush at Bildad.

239
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:29,090
But with a marvelous oblique sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.

240
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:47,860
Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt,

241
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,786
was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg.

242
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:59,858
But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing.

243
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:03,563
He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg in his ways.

244
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:16,142
As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.

245
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:17,829
He whistled at last.

246
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,152
The squall's gone off to leeward, I think.

247
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:23,397
Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance.

248
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,539
Mend that pen, will ye?

249
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,103
My jackknife here needs the grindstone.

250
00:26:27,824 --> 00:26:28,344
That's he.

251
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:29,406
Thank ye, Bildad.

252
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:32,891
Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say?

253
00:26:32,951 --> 00:26:37,438
Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.

254
00:26:37,418 --> 00:26:39,120
"'Captain Peleg,' said I.

255
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,924
"'I have a friend with me who wants to ship too.

256
00:26:42,405 --> 00:26:43,807
Shall I bring him down tomorrow?'

257
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:46,010
"'To be sure,' said Peleg.

258
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,093
"'Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.'

259
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:50,155
"'What lay does he want?'

260
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:54,581
groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.

261
00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:59,108
"'Oh, never thee mind about that, Bildad,' said Peleg.

262
00:26:59,128 --> 00:27:00,930
"'Has he ever whaled at any?'

263
00:27:01,491 --> 00:27:02,112
turning to me.

264
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:05,957
"'Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.'

265
00:27:06,072 --> 00:27:07,375
Well, bring him along then."

266
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:20,242
And, after signing the papers, off I went, nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the cape.

267
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:22,326
But I had not proceeded far.

268
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:27,533
I began to bethink me that the captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me.

269
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:44,314
Though indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command, for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,

270
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:54,417
that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship and port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.

271
00:27:55,238 --> 00:28:00,987
However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands."

272
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:06,876
Turning back, I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.

273
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,874
And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?

274
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,138
It's all right enough, thou art shipped.

275
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,703
Yes, but I should like to see him.

276
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:17,649
But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.

277
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:25,383
I don't know exactly what's the matter with him, but he keeps close inside the house, a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.

278
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:29,050
In fact, he ain't sick, but no, he isn't well either.

279
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,316
Anyhow, young man, he won't always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.

280
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:37,141
He's a queer man, Captain Ahab, so some think, but a good one.

281
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:42,168
O thought like him well enough, no fear, no fear, no fear, no fear.

282
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:46,414
He's a grand, ungodly, godlike man, Captain Ahab.

283
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:51,561
Doesn't speak much, but when he does speak, then you may well listen.

284
00:28:51,541 --> 00:29:05,517
Mark ye, be forewarned, Ahab's above the common, Ahab's been in colleges, as well as among the cannibals, been used to deeper wonders than the waves, fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales.

285
00:29:06,318 --> 00:29:06,999
His lance!

286
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,803
Ay, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle!

287
00:29:10,843 --> 00:29:11,885
Oh!

288
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:20,755
He ain't Captain Bildad, no, and he ain't Captain Peleg, he's Ahab B, boy, and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king.

289
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:22,637
and a very vile one.

290
00:29:23,077 --> 00:29:27,183
When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?

291
00:29:27,624 --> 00:29:33,572
Come hither to me, hither, hither, hither, said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me.

292
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:39,841
Look ye, lad, never say that on board the Pequod, never say that on board the Pequod, never say it anywhere.

293
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:42,584
Captain Ahab did not name himself.

294
00:29:43,065 --> 00:29:48,953
T'was a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelve-month-old.

295
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:54,042
And yet the old squaw, Tistig, at Gay Head, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic.

296
00:29:54,723 --> 00:29:57,646
And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same.

297
00:29:58,647 --> 00:29:59,527
I wish to warn thee.

298
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:00,569
It's a lie.

299
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:02,591
I know Captain Ahab well.

300
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:05,013
I've sailed with him as mate years ago.

301
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,414
I know what he is.

302
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:07,716
A good man.

303
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:11,800
Not a pious good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man.

304
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,141
Something like me.

305
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:15,784
Only there's a good deal more of him.

306
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:28,506
Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly, and I know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell, but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as anyone might see.

307
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:40,928
I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of moody, desperate moody, and savage sometimes, but that will all pass off.

308
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:48,193
And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one.

309
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,056
So good-bye to thee.

310
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:54,665
And wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name.

311
00:30:55,266 --> 00:31:01,397
Besides, my boy, he has a wife, not three voyages wedded, a sweet, resigned girl.

312
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:05,095
Think of that, by that sweet girl that old man has a child.

313
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:09,182
Hold ye, then there can be any utter hopeless harm in Ahab.

314
00:31:09,222 --> 00:31:15,133
No, no, my lad, stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities.

315
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:18,919
As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness.

316
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:26,372
What had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.

317
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:30,893
And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him.

318
00:31:30,913 --> 00:31:35,217
But for I don't know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.

319
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:38,360
And yet I also felt a strange awe of him.

320
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:42,745
But that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe.

321
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:44,647
I do not know what it was.

322
00:31:45,307 --> 00:31:54,857
But I felt it, and it did not disincline me towards him, though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.

323
00:31:54,837 --> 00:32:01,759
However, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.
