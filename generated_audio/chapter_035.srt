CHAPTER XXXIV.

2
00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:02,034
THE CABIN TIP.

3
00:00:02,154 --> 00:00:28,047
It is noon, and Dugboy the steward, thrusting his pale loaf of bread-face from the cabin scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master, who, sitting in the lee-quarter boat, has just been taking an observation of the sun, and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallion-shaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg.

4
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:35,337
From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial.

5
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:46,693
But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying,

6
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:56,885
disappears into the cabin, when the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck, the first emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated.

7
00:00:56,905 --> 00:01:08,800
Then Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep into the benical, says, with some touch of pleasantness,

8
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,185
Dinner, Mr. Stubb, and descends the scuttle.

9
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:21,758
The second emir lounges about the rigging a while, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important rope.

10
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,126
He likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid

11
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:42,869
Dinner, Mr. Flask follows after his predecessors, but the third emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck, seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his shoes.

12
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:56,910
He strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk's head, and then, by a dexterous slate pitching his cap up into the mizen top for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck.

13
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,296
reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music.

14
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:15,803
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, shifts a new face altogether, and then, independent, hilarious little flask, enters King Ahab's presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.

15
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:21,092
It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea usages

16
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:45,072
But while in the open air of the deck some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defiantly enough towards their commander—ye dead, ten to one—let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table, tush, is marvellous, sometimes most comical.

17
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:46,999
Wherefore this difference?

18
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:48,142
A problem?

19
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,224
Perhaps not.

20
00:02:49,685 --> 00:03:01,272
To have been Belshazzar king of Babylon, and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily, but courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur.

21
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:19,682
But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit Presides over his own private dinner-table Of invited guests, that man's unchallenged Power and dominion of individual influence For the time, that man's royalty of state Transcends Belshazzar's.

22
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:26,596
for Belshazzar was not the greatest, who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Caesar.

23
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:31,947
It is a witchery of social tsarship, which there is no withstanding.

24
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:38,481
Now, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a shipmaster,

25
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:44,252
Then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.

26
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:55,233
Over his ivory and laid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maimed sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs.

27
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,541
In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served.

28
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:06,698
They were as little children before Ahab, and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.

29
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:15,319
With one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife as he carved the chief dish before him.

30
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:25,171
I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.

31
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:41,070
No, and when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms, and cut it tenderly.

32
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:47,783
and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate, Pomme chewed, noiselessly.

33
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:51,149
Tant jouled it not without circumspection.

34
00:04:51,730 --> 00:05:02,350
For, like the coronation banquet at Frankfurt, where the German emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals,

35
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:07,920
eaten in awful silence, and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation.

36
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,202
Only he himself was dumb.

37
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:16,568
What a relief it was to choking stub when a vat made a sudden racket in the hold below!

38
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,450
And poor little Flask!

39
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,014
He was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party.

40
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:27,137
His were the shin-bones of the saline beef.

41
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:32,522
His would have been the drum-sticks for Flask to have presumed to help himself.

42
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:37,289
This must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree.

43
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:44,880
Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world.

44
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:56,237
Nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him, and had Flask helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.

45
00:05:56,457 --> 00:06:00,383
Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.

46
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:16,022
Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion, whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him.

47
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,226
A subaltern ends, however it was.

48
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:22,509
Flask, alas, was a butterless man.

49
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,131
Another thing.

50
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:28,817
Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is the first man up.

51
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:34,248
Consider, for hereby Flask's dinner was badly jammed in point of time.

52
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:48,898
Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him, and yet they also had the privilege of lounging in the rear, if Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite.

53
00:06:48,878 --> 00:06:54,746
and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself.

54
00:06:55,327 --> 00:07:03,218
He will not get more than three mouthfuls that day, for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck.

55
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:16,557
Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise unhungry.

56
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:22,504
more or less, for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him.

57
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:28,691
Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.

58
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:37,301
I am an officer, but how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mass.

59
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:44,890
There's the fruits of promotion now, there's the vanity of glory, there's the insanity of life.

60
00:07:44,870 --> 00:08:07,229
Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask and Flask's official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at Flask through the cabin skylight, sitting silly and dumbfounded before awful Ahab.

61
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:14,775
Now Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequod's cabin.

62
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:25,697
After their departure, taking place in inverted order to their arrival, the canvas-cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.

63
00:08:26,118 --> 00:08:32,832
And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees,

64
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:53,993
They made a sort of temporary servants' hall, of the high and mighty cabin, in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire carefree license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows, the harpeneers.

65
00:08:53,973 --> 00:09:05,276
While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpeneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it.

66
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:13,332
They dined like lords, they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.

67
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:35,742
Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale dough-boy was feigned to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox, and if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip and jump,

68
00:09:35,722 --> 00:10:00,312
Then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise, and once Dagu, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Doboy's memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him.

69
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:10,456
He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward, the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.

70
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:19,971
And what with the standing spectacle of the black, terrific Ahab, and the periodical, tumultuous visitations of these three savages,

71
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:23,837
Doboy's whole life was one continual lip-quiver.

72
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:36,576
Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them

73
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:40,000
through the blinds of its door, till all was over.

74
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:49,130
It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his vile teeth to the Indians crosswise to them.

75
00:10:49,170 --> 00:11:05,888
Dagu seated on the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low car-lines, at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship.

76
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:10,975
But for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.

77
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:22,771
It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.

78
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:34,828
But, Dalthus, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air, and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds.

79
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:58,538
not by beef or by bread, or giants made or nourished, but Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating an ugly sound, enough so much so, that the trembling dough-boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own mean arms, and when he would hear Tash-Tegu singing out for him to produce himself,

80
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:08,950
that his bones might be picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy.

81
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:22,466
Nor did the whetstone, which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances and other weapons, and, with whetstones, at dinner, they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives.

82
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:28,153
That grating sound did not at all tend to tranquilize poor Doughboy.

83
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:37,245
How could he forget that in his island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some murderous, condivial indiscretions?

84
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:38,408
Alas!

85
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,662
Doughboy, hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.

86
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,296
Not a napkin should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.

87
00:12:47,776 --> 00:13:03,844
In good time, though, to his great delight, The three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart, To his credulous, fable-mangering ears, All their martial bones jingling in them at every step, Like Moorish scimitars in scabbards.

88
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:22,356
But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived there still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were scarcely ever in it except at meal-times, and just before sleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.

89
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:49,170
In this one matter Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale-captains, who, as is set, rather inclined to the opinion that by rights the ship's cabin belongs to them, and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there, so that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin

90
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,032
been in it.

91
00:13:50,152 --> 00:14:03,819
For when they did enter it, it was something as a street door enters a house, turning inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next on as a permanent thing, residing in the open air.

92
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,388
Nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially.

93
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:10,973
Ahab was inaccessible.

94
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:16,740
Though nominally included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it.

95
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:25,110
He lived in the world as the last of the grizzly bears lived in settled Missouri, and as when spring and summer had departed.

96
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:40,808
That wild Logan of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his own paws, so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul shut up in the cave trunk of his body,

97
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:44,284
They're fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom.
