00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:15,091
CHAPTER XLVIII THE FIRST LAURING The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there.

2
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:24,604
This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter.

3
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:34,906
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips.

4
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:49,005
A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funerially invested him, with wide black trousers of the same dark stuff, but strangely crowning this eboness was a glistening white-plaited turban

5
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:52,869
than living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head.

6
00:00:53,450 --> 00:01:16,613
Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid tiger-yellow complexion, peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives, of the Manillas, a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtlety, and by some honest white mariners, supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water.

7
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:24,105
While yet the wandering ship's company were gazing upon these strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head.

8
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:26,068
"'Already there, Fedela?'

9
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:28,993
"'Ready,' was the half-hissed reply.

10
00:01:29,013 --> 00:01:33,461
"'Lower away, then, D. A. A., shouting across the deck.

11
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:36,205
Lower away there,' I say."

12
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:54,227
Such was the thunder of his voice, that, spite of their amazement, the men sprang over the rail, the sheaves whirled round in the blocks, with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea, while, with a dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation,

13
00:01:54,207 --> 00:02:01,420
The sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into the tossed boats below.

14
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:13,802
Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's slee, when a fourth keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern and showed the five strangers rowing aham.

15
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:32,314
Who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed, Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water, but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swat Fadala and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.

16
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:36,060
"'Captain Ahab,' said Starbuck.

17
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,744
"'Spread yourselves,' cried Ahab.

18
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:40,667
"'Give way, all four boats.

19
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:43,151
Now, Flask, pull out more to Leawood.'

20
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:48,961
"'Aye, aye, sir,' cheerily cried little King Post, sweeping round his great steering oar.

21
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:51,805
"'Lay back,' addressing his crew.

22
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,741
There, there, there again.

23
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:56,306
There she blows right ahead, boys.

24
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:57,328
Lay back."

25
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:00,655
Never he jaundered yellow boys, Archie.

26
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:11,937
"'I don't mind him, sir,' said Archie.

27
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:19,351
Pull, pull, my fine heart's alive, Pull, my children, pull, my little ones.

28
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:26,078
Drawingly and soothingly sighed A stub to his crew, some of whom Still showed signs of uneasiness.

29
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,282
Why don't you break your back-zones, my boys?

30
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:30,943
What is it you stare at?

31
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,286
Those chaps in yonder boat?

32
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:39,713
Tut, there only five more hands Come to help us, never mind from where The more the merrier.

33
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:45,551
Pull, then, do pull, never mind, The brimstone devils are good fellows enough.

34
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:53,314
So, so, there you are now, That's the stroke for a thousand pounds, That's the stroke to sweep the stakes.

35
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:57,418
Well, hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes.

36
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,102
Three cheers, men all hearts alive.

37
00:04:00,663 --> 00:04:03,408
Easy, easy, don't be in a hurry, don't be in a hurry.

38
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,012
Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals?

39
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:07,575
Bite something, you dogs.

40
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:11,061
So, so, so, then call softly, softly.

41
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,305
That's in, that's it.

42
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:14,627
Long and strong.

43
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:16,016
Give way there!

44
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:16,998
Give way!

45
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,281
The devil fetch ye!

46
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:22,646
He rag'em off and rapskally on, Zee, you're all asleep.

47
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:25,230
Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.

48
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,552
Pull, will ye?

49
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:27,453
Pull, can't ye?

50
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,615
Pull, won't ye?

51
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:33,502
Why, in the name of gudgeons and ginger cakes, don't ye pull, pull, and break something, Pot?

52
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:36,727
Pull, and start your eyes out here!"

53
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:39,130
whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle.

54
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:44,183
Every mother's son of he draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth.

55
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:45,525
That's it.

56
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:46,808
That's it.

57
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,931
Now you do something.

58
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:50,456
That looks like it, my steel bits.

59
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:51,518
Start her.

60
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:52,260
Start her.

61
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:53,563
My silver spools.

62
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:54,665
Start her.

63
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,950
Marling spikes.

64
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:07,434
Stubbs' exhortium to his crew was given here at large, because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them, in general, and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing.

65
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:16,474
But you must not suppose, from this specimen of his sermonizings, that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation.

66
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:21,104
not at all, and therein consisted his chief peculiarity.

67
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:36,015
He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations.

68
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:41,005
without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing.

69
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:55,995
Besides, he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering oar, and so broadly gaped open mouth at times that the mere sight of such a yawning commander

70
00:05:55,975 --> 00:06:00,401
by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew.

71
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:13,398
Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.

72
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:24,953
In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubb's bow, and when, for a minute or so, the two boats were pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate,

73
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:29,119
Mr. Starbuck, Laboard Boat Bear, Ahoy!

74
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,482
A word with you, sir, if you please.

75
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:43,600
Returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke, still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew, his face set like a flint from stubs.

76
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,064
"'What think ye of those yellow boys, sir?'

77
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:49,630
smuggled on board somehow, before the ship sailed.

78
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:55,679
"'Strong, strong boys,' in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again.

79
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,584
"'A sad business, Mr. Stubb.

80
00:06:58,925 --> 00:07:00,667
See there, see there, my lads.

81
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,292
But never mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best.

82
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:07,258
Let all your crew pull strong, come what will.'

83
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:09,201
Spring, my men, spring!

84
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:13,848
There's hog-heads of sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb, And that's what ye came for.

85
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,213
Pull, my boys, sperm, Sperm's the play.

86
00:07:17,714 --> 00:07:20,838
This at least is duty, Duty and profit, hand in hand.

87
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:26,547
Ay, I thought as much, soliloquized Stubb, When the boats diverged.

88
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:29,592
As soon as I clapped I on M, I thought so.

89
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:36,605
Aye, and that's what he went into the after-hold for, so often, as Doughboy long suspected.

90
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:40,211
They were hidden down there, the white whales at the bottom of it.

91
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:42,816
Well, well, so be it.

92
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:44,198
Can't be helped.

93
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,220
All right.

94
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:47,083
Give way, man.

95
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:51,433
It ain't the White Whale to-day, give way, Now the advent of these others."

96
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:53,838
It took off the extreme edge of their wonder.

97
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:04,482
And so, what with all this, and Stubbs' confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings.

98
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:15,141
though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to Dark Ahab's precise agency in the matter from the beginning.

99
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:28,765
For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elisha.

100
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:42,038
Meantime Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sighted the furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats, ah, circumstance bespeaking, how potent a crew was pulling him.

101
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:55,731
Those tiger-yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whale-bone, like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the boat along the water

102
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:59,960
like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer.

103
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:14,833
As for Fedala, who was seen pulling the harpoonier oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon.

104
00:09:14,813 --> 00:09:30,240
While at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer's, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip, Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat-lowerings ere the white whale had torn him.

105
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:40,462
All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed, while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.

106
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:43,104
Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea.

107
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:47,709
Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way.

108
00:09:48,389 --> 00:10:00,480
The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.

109
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,045
"'Every man look out along his oars,' cried Starbuck.

110
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:07,049
"'Thou, Queequeg, stand up!'

111
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:19,988
Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been described.

112
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:39,401
Likewise, upon the extreme stern of the boat, where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.

113
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:44,389
Not very far distant, Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still,

114
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:56,440
its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform.

115
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,370
It is used for catching turns with the whale-line.

116
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:13,531
Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man's hand, and standing upon such a base as that, flasks seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks.

117
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:27,252
But little King Post was small and short, and at the same time little King Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead standpoint of his did by no means satisfy King Post.

118
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:29,295
I can't see three seas off.

119
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:32,521
Tip us up an oar there, and let me on to that."

120
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:42,658
Upon this, Dagu, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way, swiftly slid aft, and then, erecting himself, volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal.

121
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:45,986
Good a mast-head as any, sir.

122
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,409
Will you mount?

123
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,955
That I will, and thank ye very much.

124
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:53,784
My fine fellow, only I wish you fifty feet taller.

125
00:11:53,824 --> 00:12:01,862
Whereupon, planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little,

126
00:12:01,842 --> 00:12:17,218
presented his flat palm to Flask's foot, and then, putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed head, and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders.

127
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:26,515
And here was Flask now standing, Dagu with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breast-band to lean against and steady himself by.

128
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:43,476
At any time it is a strange sight to the Tyrell to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas.

129
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:50,108
still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances.

130
00:12:50,449 --> 00:13:02,832
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Dagu was yet more curious, for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought-of, barbaric majesty.

131
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:07,598
The noble negro, to every roll of the sea, harmoniously rolled his fine form.

132
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:11,663
On his broad back, flaxen-haired flasks seemed a snowflake.

133
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:14,267
The bearer looked nobler than the rider.

134
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:27,964
Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience, but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly chest.

135
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:32,430
So have I seen passion and vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth.

136
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,036
but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.

137
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:42,348
Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes.

138
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:48,739
The whales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary dive for mere fright.

139
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,790
And if that were the case, Stubb, as is wont in such cases, it seems,

140
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,413
was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe.

141
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:04,679
He withdrew it from his hat-band, where he always wore it aslant like a feather.

142
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:24,777
He loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end, but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sand-paper of his hand, when Tash Tego, his haponier, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,

143
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:32,385
Crying out in a quick frenzy of hurry, Down, down all, and give way, there they are!

144
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:52,266
To a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring Would have been visible at that moment, Nothing but a troubled bit of greenish-white water, And thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, And suffusingly blowing off to leeward, Like the confused scud from white rolling billows.

145
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:59,875
The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron.

146
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:18,777
Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of water, also the whales were swimming, seen in advance of all the other indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.

147
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:25,026
All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air.

148
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:34,352
But it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on, as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.

149
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:53,387
"'Pull, pull, my good boys,' said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men, while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses.

150
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:57,935
He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him.

151
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:08,072
Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with command.

152
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,898
Sing out and say something, my hearties, raw, and pull my thunderbolts.

153
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,703
Beach me, beach me on their black backs.

154
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,185
Boys do that for me.

155
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:20,170
and I'll sign over to you my Martha's Vineyard Plantation.

156
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:25,577
Boys, including wife and children boys, lay me on, lay me on.

157
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:29,823
O Lord, Lord, but I shall go stark staring mad.

158
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,166
See, see that white water!"

159
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:38,815
And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it, then picking it up,

160
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:47,988
flirted it far off upon the sea, and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.

161
00:16:48,629 --> 00:17:00,026
Look at that chap now, philosophically drawl-stub, who, with his unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short distance, followed after.

162
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:07,637
He's got fits that flask has—fits, yes, give him fits, that's the very word-pitch, fits into M.

163
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:12,839
Merrily, merrily, hearts alive, Putting for supper, you know Mary's the word.

164
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:18,646
Pull, babes, pull, sucklings, pull, all, But what the devil are you hurrying about?

165
00:17:19,307 --> 00:17:24,935
Softly, softly, and steadily, my men, Only pull, and keep pulling, nothing more.

166
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:29,541
Crack all your backbones, And bite your knives in two, that's all.

167
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:35,692
Take it easy, why don't ye take it easy, I say, and first all your livers and lungs."

168
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:43,926
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of his, these were words best omitted here.

169
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:48,073
For you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land.

170
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:52,761
Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words.

171
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:59,648
when, with tornado-brow and eyes of red murder and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.

172
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:03,091
Meanwhile all the boats tore on.

173
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:20,048
The repeated, specific allusions of Flask to that whale, as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its tail, these allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelike

174
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:25,893
that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder.

175
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:40,526
But this was against all rule, for the oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks, a sage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.

176
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:44,269
It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe.

177
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,853
The vast swells of the omnipotent sea, the surging hollow roar they made,

178
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:53,744
as they rolled along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowl in green-green.

179
00:18:54,265 --> 00:19:05,830
The brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatened to cut it in two, the sudden profound dip into the watery glands and hollows.

180
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,595
Begins bearings and goadings to gatings to gain the top of the opposite hill.

181
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:14,302
Pedlong, sledlong, slide down its other side, down its other side, all these wheels with the head.

182
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:21,252
Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle.

183
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:26,940
Not the dead man's ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world.

184
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:33,049
Neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does.

185
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:40,182
who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm-whale.

186
00:19:40,283 --> 00:19:50,582
The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dumb cloud-shadows flung upon the sea.

187
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:56,551
The jets of vapour no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left.

188
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:59,536
The whales seemed separating their wakes.

189
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:06,647
The boats were pulled more apart, Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward.

190
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:22,594
Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along the boat, going with such madness through the water that the liors could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks.

191
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,034
Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist on either ship nor boat to be seen.

192
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:34,691
Give way, men, whispered Starber, drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail.

193
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:39,283
There is time to kill a fish yet, before the squall comes.

194
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:41,065
There's white water again.

195
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:42,908
Close to—Spring!"

196
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:57,046
Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast, but hardly were they overheard, when, with a lightning-like hurtling whisper, Starbucks said, "'Stand up!'

197
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:00,951
and Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.

198
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:15,953
Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life-and-death peril so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had come.

199
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:23,148
They heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.

200
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:32,828
Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.

201
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:34,610
That's his hump.

202
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:38,654
There, there, give it to him," whispered Starba.

203
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:41,537
A short, rushing sound leaped out of the boat.

204
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:44,159
It was the darted iron of Kwekwe.

205
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:48,444
Then, all in one welded commotion, came an invisible push from a stern.

206
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:51,887
While forward, the boat seemed striking on a ledge.

207
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:54,590
The sail collapsed and exploded.

208
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,853
Gush of scalding vapour shot up nearby.

209
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:01,937
Something rolled and tumbled, like an earthquake beneath us.

210
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:08,807
The whole crew were half-suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall.

211
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:17,501
Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blundered together, and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.

212
00:22:18,141 --> 00:22:21,547
Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.

213
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:27,115
Swimming round it, we picked up the floating oars and, lashing them across the gunwale,

214
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,197
tumbled back to our places.

215
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:43,852
There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward-gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean.

216
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:56,545
The wind increased to a howl, the waves dashed their bucklers together, the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed,

217
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:59,688
we were burning immortal in these jaws of death.

218
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:09,499
In vain we hailed the other boats as well, roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace, as hail those boats in that storm.

219
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,625
Meanwhile the driving scud, wrack and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night.

220
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:18,008
No sign of the ship could be seen.

221
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:22,853
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bail out the boat.

222
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:28,419
The oars were useless as propellers, performing now the office of life preservers.

223
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,063
So...

224
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:43,697
Cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern, then stretching it on a wave-pole, handed it to Creekquake as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope.

225
00:23:44,518 --> 00:23:50,544
There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness.

226
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:56,029
There, men, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith.

227
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:08,078
Hopelessly holding up hope, in the midst of despair, wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on.

228
00:24:09,256 --> 00:24:11,299
The mist still spread over the sea.

229
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,383
The empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.

230
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:19,170
Suddenly Kwee Kwek started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.

231
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,996
We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm.

232
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:26,880
The sound came nearer and nearer.

233
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:31,146
The thick mists were dimly parted by a huge vague form.

234
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:42,837
Afrighted, we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length.

235
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:59,952
Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip at the base of a cataract, and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern.

236
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:07,743
Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on board.

237
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:16,416
Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.

238
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:24,888
The ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if happily it might light upon some token of our perishing, an oar or a lance-pole.

239
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:25,990
Ah!
