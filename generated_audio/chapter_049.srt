00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:18,917
Chapter 49 - The Hyena. There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own.

2
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:22,966
However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worthwhile disputing.

3
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:37,480
He bolts down all events, all creeds and beliefs and persuasions, all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby, as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints.

4
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:54,861
And as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life and limb, all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker.

5
00:00:54,841 --> 00:01:01,427
That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation.

6
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:11,036
It comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke.

7
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:24,409
There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy, and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod and the great white whale its object.

8
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:32,557
"'Queequeg,' said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water.

9
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:36,382
"'Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?'

10
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:44,452
Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to understand that such things did often happen.

11
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:45,473
"'Mr.

12
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:52,742
Stubb,' said I, turning to that worthy who, buttoned up in his oil jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain.

13
00:01:52,722 --> 00:02:01,256
Mr. Stubb, I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent.

14
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:09,129
I suppose, then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion?

15
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,331
Certain.

16
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:14,798
I've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn.

17
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:15,179
"'Mr.

18
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:22,215
Flask,' said I, turning to Little King Post who was standing close by, "'you are experienced in these things, and I am not.

19
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:33,259
"'Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, "'for an oarsman to break his own back, "'pulling himself back foremost into death's jaws?'

20
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,701
Can't you twist that smaller?"

21
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:36,063
said Flask.

22
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,045
Yes, that's the law.

23
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:41,351
I should like to see a boat's crew backing water up to a whale face, foremost.

24
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:42,212
Ha!

25
00:02:42,532 --> 00:02:42,773
Ha!

26
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:45,477
The whale would give them squint for squint, mind that.

27
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:46,638
Hear them!

28
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:51,486
From three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of the entire case.

29
00:02:52,146 --> 00:03:00,799
Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacs on the deep were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life,

30
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:08,899
Considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale, I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat.

31
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:33,979
Oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings, considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck's driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery, considering theâ€”Kwek-kwek, said I, come along.

32
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,502
You shall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee.

33
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:46,405
It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion.

34
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:51,441
This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing.

35
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:56,010
After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier.

36
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,174
A stone was rolled away from my heart.

37
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:04,866
Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection.

38
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:10,155
A supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be.

39
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:14,300
I survived myself, my death and burial were locked up in my chest.

40
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:22,489
I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.

41
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:33,662
Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock, here goes for a cool collected dive at death and destruction and the devil fetch the hindmost.
