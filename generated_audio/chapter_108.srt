1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,932
Chapter 108 - Ahab and the Carpenter.

2
00:00:01,013 --> 00:00:02,976
Chapter 108 - Ahab and the Carpenter.

3
00:00:03,497 --> 00:00:03,897
The Deck.

4
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:05,239
First Night Watch.

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,802
Carpenter standing.

6
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:08,465
Before his vice.

7
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:13,633
Bench, and by the light of two lanterns, busily filing the ivory.

8
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:18,681
Joist for the leg, which joist is firmly fixed in the vice.

9
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:25,284
Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench.

10
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:31,697
Forward, the red flame of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work, draught the file, and draught the bone.

11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,687
That is hard which should be soft, and that is soft which should be hard.

12
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:39,934
So we go, who file old jaws and shin bones.

13
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:41,397
Let's try another.

14
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:43,480
Aye, now, this works better.

15
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:44,442
Senoneses.

16
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,327
Halloa, this bone dust is senoneses.

17
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,070
Why, it's S-enoneses.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,913
Yes, it's S-enoneses.

19
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,436
Yes, it's S-enoses.

20
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:55,080
Bless my soul, it won't let me speak.

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,145
This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber.

22
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,531
Saw a live tree, and you don't get this dust.

23
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:04,376
Amputate a live bone, and you don't get it.

24
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:05,297
S&Es.

25
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,802
Come, come, you old smut.

26
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:11,408
There, bear a hand, and let's have that ferule and buckle screw.

27
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:13,812
I'll be ready for them presently.

28
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:15,315
Lucky now, senese.

29
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:21,647
There's no kneeses, there's no knee joint to make, that might puzzle a little, but a mere shinbone.

30
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:26,636
Why it's easy as making hop poles, only I should like to put a good finish on.

31
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:33,008
Time, time, if I but only had the time, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever.

32
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:37,116
Segses scrape to a lady in a parlor.

33
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:41,815
Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I've seen in shop windows wouldn't compare at all.

34
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:46,504
They soak water, they do, and of course get rheumatic and have to be doctored.

35
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:50,171
Segs with washes and lotions, just like live legs.

36
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:57,065
There, before I saw it off, now I must call his old mogul ship and see whether the length will be all right.

37
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:59,610
Too short, if anything, I guess.

38
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:00,197
Ha!

39
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:01,379
That's the heel.

40
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:02,339
We are in luck.

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,062
Here he comes, or it's somebody else, that's certain.

42
00:02:05,763 --> 00:02:06,524
A.H.A.B.

43
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:10,187
Advancing during the ensign's scene, the carpenter continues.

44
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:12,490
Sneezing at times.

45
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,891
Well, manmaker.

46
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:15,293
Just in time, sir.

47
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:18,075
If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length.

48
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:19,657
Let me measure, sir.

49
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:21,399
Measured for a leg.

50
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,139
Good.

51
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,682
Well, it's not the first time.

52
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:25,723
About it.

53
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:26,644
There.

54
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:28,686
Keep thy finger on it.

55
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,269
This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter.

56
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,811
Let me feel its grip once.

57
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,575
So, so, it does pinch some.

58
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,998
Oh, sir, it will break bones.

59
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:39,560
Beware, beware.

60
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,123
No fear, I like a good grip.

61
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:45,748
I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold man.

62
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,691
What's Prometheus about there?

63
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,132
The blacksmith, I mean.

64
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:50,214
What's he about?

65
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:53,458
He must be forging the buckle screw, sir, now.

66
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,094
Right, it's a partnership, he supplies the muscle part.

67
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:59,177
He makes a fierce red flame there.

68
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,822
Aye, sir, he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.

69
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:06,006
Um, um, so he must.

70
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:21,387
I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith and animated them with fire, for what's made in fire must properly belong to fire, and so hell's probable.

71
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,733
How the soot flies, this must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of.

72
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:30,900
Carpenter, when he's through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder blades.

73
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,283
There's a peddler aboard with a crushing pack.

74
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:34,305
Sir?

75
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:40,253
Hold, while Prometheus is about it, I'll order a complete man after a desirable pattern.

76
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:56,974
Imprimus, fifty feet high in his socks, then, chest mottled after the Thames tunnel, then, legs with roots to him, to stay in one place, then, arms three feet through the wrist, no heart at all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains, and let me see.

77
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:59,878
Shall I order eyes to see outwards?

78
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:03,924
No, but put a skylight on top of his head to illuminate inwards.

79
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,387
There, take the order, and away.

80
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:10,954
Now what's he speaking about, and who's he speaking to, I should like to know.

81
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:12,916
Shall I keep standing here?

82
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:14,298
Aside.

83
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:18,424
Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome, here's one.

84
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:19,706
No, no, no.

85
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:20,968
I must have a lantern.

86
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:21,689
Ho!

87
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:22,169
Ho!

88
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,271
That's it, hey?

89
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,393
Here are two, sir.

90
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:25,614
One will serve my turn.

91
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:29,199
What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?

92
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,144
Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.

93
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:34,867
I thought, sir, that you spoke to Carpenter.

94
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:35,949
Carpenter?

95
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:42,258
Why, that'sâ€”but no, a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely gentleman-like sort of business.

96
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,504
Thou art in here, Carpenter, or wouldst thou rather work in clay?

97
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:46,928
Sir?

98
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:48,730
Clay, clay, sir?

99
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,032
That's mud.

100
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,794
We leave clay to ditchers, sir.

101
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:53,035
The fellow's imbious.

102
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:54,517
What art thou sneezing about?

103
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:56,519
Bone is rather dusty, sir.

104
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,325
Take the hint, then, and when thou art dead never bury thyself under living people's noses.

105
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:02,486
Sir?

106
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:04,949
Oh, ah, I guess so.

107
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,171
Yes, may.

108
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:07,532
Look ye, carpenter.

109
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,817
I dare say thou callest thyself a right good workman like workman, eh?

110
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:22,371
Well then, will it speak thoroughly well for thy work if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it?

111
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:27,662
That is, carpenter, my old lost leg, the flesh and blood, one I mean.

112
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:29,906
Canst thou not drive that old Adam away?

113
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:33,472
Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now.

114
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:44,070
Yes, I have heard something curious on that score, sir, how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking him at times.

115
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:47,676
May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?

116
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:48,906
It is, man.

117
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:52,894
Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was.

118
00:05:52,934 --> 00:06:00,388
So, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul, where thou feelest tingling life.

119
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,917
There, exactly there, there to a hair, do I. Isn't a riddle?

120
00:06:05,678 --> 00:06:07,842
I should humbly call it a poser, sir.

121
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:18,490
Hist, then, how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest?

122
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:20,706
I am standing there in thy spite.

123
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:26,478
In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers, hold, don't speak?

124
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:39,043
And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved, then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body?

125
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:39,678
Ha!

126
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:40,680
Good lord!

127
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,845
Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again.

128
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:47,689
I think I didn't carry a small figure, sir.

129
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,793
Looky, putting heads should never grand premises.

130
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,996
How long before the leg is done?

131
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:54,639
Perhaps an hour, sir.

132
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:58,604
Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me, turns to go.

133
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:07,596
Oh, life, here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on.

134
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:11,903
Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers.

135
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:16,490
I would be free as air, and I'm down in the whole world's books.

136
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:27,508
I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest praetorians at the auction of the Roman Empire, which was the world's, and yet I owe for the flesh and the tongue I brag with.

137
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:34,551
By heavens, I'll get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to one small compendious vertebra.

138
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:38,196
So, Carpenter resuming his work.

139
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:39,839
Well, well, well.

140
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,586
Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says he's queer.

141
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:47,391
Says nothing but that one sufficient little word, queer.

142
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:49,555
He's queer, says Stubb.

143
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:55,144
He's queer, queer, queer, queer, and keeps dinning it into Mr. Starbuck all the time.

144
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:58,210
Queer, sir, queer, queer, very queer.

145
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,552
And here's his leg.

146
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,116
Yes, now that I think of it, here's his bedfellow.

147
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:05,342
Has a stick of whale's jawbone for a wife.

148
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:08,708
And this is his leg, he'll sting of whale's jawbone for a wife.

149
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:11,654
And this is his leg, he'll stand on this.

150
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:18,026
What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and all three places standing in one hell?

151
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:19,348
How was that?

152
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,275
Oh, I don't wonder he looks so scornful at me.

153
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:28,545
I'm a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say, but that's only haphazard-like.

154
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:35,872
Then, a short little old body like me should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains.

155
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:40,336
The water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and there's a great cry for lifeboats.

156
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:44,340
And here's the heron's leg, long and slim, sure enough.

157
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:54,650
Now, for most folks, one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach, horses.

158
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:57,773
But Ahab, oh he's a hard driver.

159
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:03,923
Look, driven one leg to death, and spaven the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.

160
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,227
Halloa there, you smut!

161
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:17,706
Bear a hand there with those screws, and let's finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as gruery men go round collecting old beer barrels to fill them up again.

162
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:19,609
What a leg this is!

163
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,640
It looks like a real live leg, filed down to nothing but the core.

164
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:25,826
He'll be standing on this tomorrow.

165
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:27,771

Halloa!

167
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:34,209

168
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:39,403
Sew, sew, chisel, file, and sandpaper, now!
