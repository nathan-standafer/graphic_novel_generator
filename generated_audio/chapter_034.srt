00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:25,296
Chapter 34 - The Cabin Table. It is noon, and Doughboy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread face from the cabin scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master, who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of the sun, and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg.

2
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:30,804
From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would think that Moody Ahab had not heard his menial.

3
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:41,380
But presently, catching hold of the mizzen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, Dinner, Mr. Starbuck, disappears into the cabin.

4
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,832
When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck, the first emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated,

5
00:00:49,812 --> 00:01:03,091
Then Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness, Dinner, Mr. Stub, and descends the scuttle.

6
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:08,819
The second emir lounges about the ricking a while, and then slightly shaking the main brace.

7
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:19,414
To see whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid, Dinner, Mr. Flask, follows after his predecessors.

8
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:26,673
But the third emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarterdeck, seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint.

9
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:46,920
For, tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk's head, and then, by a dexterous slight, pitching his cap up into the mizzentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck.

10
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,588
reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music.

11
00:01:51,270 --> 00:02:05,162
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little flask enters King Ahab's presence in the character of Objectus or the Slave.

12
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:33,141
It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea usages, that while in the open air of the deck some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander, yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of the table.

13
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:36,225
This is marvelous, sometimes most comical.

14
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:38,688
Wherefore this difference?

15
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,209
A problem?

16
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,510
Perhaps not.

17
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:51,825
To have been Belshazzar, king of Babylon, and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur.

18
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:59,635
But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests,

19
00:02:59,615 --> 00:03:04,545
that man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time.

20
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:08,393
That man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's.

21
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:15,948
For Belshazzar was not the greatest, who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Caesar.

22
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,678
It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.

23
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:31,275
Now, if to this consideration you super-add the official supremacy of a shipmaster, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.

24
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:41,874
Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, manned sea lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs.

25
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,040
In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served.

26
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:53,890
They were as little children before Ahab, and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.

27
00:03:54,591 --> 00:04:01,920
With one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife as he carved the chief dish before him.

28
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:10,678
I do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.

29
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,360
No!

30
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:33,223
And when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms, and cut it tenderly, and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate, and chewed it noiselessly, and swallowed it, not without circumspection.

31
00:04:33,203 --> 00:04:33,644
4.

32
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:50,350
Like the coronation banquet at Frankfurt, where the German emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence, and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation, only he himself was dumb.

33
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:56,359
What a relief it was to choking stub when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.

34
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,868
And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party.

35
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,695
His were the shinbones of the saline beef, his would have been the drumsticks.

36
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:13,486
For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree.

37
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:20,256
Had he helped himself at that table doubtless, never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world.

38
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:24,523
Nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.

39
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:29,827
And had Flask helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.

40
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:49,670
Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter, whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion, or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern.

41
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:54,375
However it was, Flask, alas, was a butterless man.

42
00:05:54,997 --> 00:06:00,385
Another thing, Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is the first man up.

43
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:05,633
Consider, for hereby Flask's dinner was badly jammed in point of time.

44
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:11,622
Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him, and yet they also had the privilege of lounging in the rear.

45
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:22,240
If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself.

46
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:28,870
He will not get more than three mouthfuls that day, for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck.

47
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:41,288
Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.

48
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:46,319
For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him.

49
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:52,324
Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have forever departed from my stomach.

50
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:59,882
I am an officer, but how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle as I used to when I was before the mast.

51
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:05,612
There's the fruits of promotion now, there's the vanity of glory, there's the insanity of life.

52
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:13,806
Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official capacity,

53
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:25,973
All that Sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go after dinnertime and get a peep at Flask through the cabin skylight, sitting silly and dumbfounded before awful Ahab.

54
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:31,674
Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequod's cabin.

55
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:42,167
After their departure, taking place in inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.

56
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:47,453
And then the three harpooners were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees.

57
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,758
They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of the high and mighty cabin.

58
00:07:52,177 --> 00:08:06,213
In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain's table was the entire carefree license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows, the harpooneers.

59
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:16,665
While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it.

60
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:17,948
They dined like lords.

61
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:22,337
They filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.

62
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:37,810
Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale doughboy, was feigned to bring on a great baron of salt junk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.

63
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:48,802
And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.

64
00:08:49,543 --> 00:09:03,679
And once Dagu, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Doughboy's memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him.

65
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:12,842
He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward, the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.

66
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:24,692
And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Doboy's whole life was one continual lit quiver.

67
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:37,986
Commonly, after seeing the harpooners furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over.

68
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:45,738
It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his filed teeth to the Indians, crosswise to them.

69
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:59,940
Dagu seated on the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low car lines, at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship.

70
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,517
But for all this, the great Negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.

71
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:15,552
It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.

72
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:27,109
But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air, and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds.

73
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:31,528
Not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished.

74
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:44,545
But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating, an ugly sound enough, so much so, that the trembling doe, boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms.

75
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:54,818
And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry,

76
00:10:54,798 --> 00:11:11,541
by his sudden fits of the palsy, nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their lances and other weapons, and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives, that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquilize poor Doughboy.

77
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:19,409
How could he forget that in his island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.

78
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:20,712
Alas!

79
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,860
Doughboy hardfares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.

80
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:29,108
Not a napkin should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.

81
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:44,481
In good time, though, to his great delight, The three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart To his credulous, fable-mongering ears, All their martial bones jingling in them at every step, Like Moorish scimitars and scabbards.

82
00:11:44,630 --> 00:12:00,573
But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived there, still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.

83
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:12,730
In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains, who, as a set, rather inclined to the opinion that by rights the ship's cabin belongs to them,

84
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:18,013
and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else's, at any time, permitted there.

85
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:26,663
So that, in real truth, the mates and harpooners of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.

86
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:39,038
For when they did enter it, it was something as a street door enters a house, turning inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next, and, as a permanent thing, residing in the open air.

87
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:45,345
Nor did they lose much hereby, in the cabin was no companionship, socially Ahab was inaccessible.

88
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:50,110
Though nominally included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it.

89
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:54,996
He lived in the world, as the last of the grizzly bears lived in settled Missouri.

90
00:12:55,696 --> 00:13:05,447
And as when spring and summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his own paws.

91
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:14,357
So, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom.
