00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:17,783
Chapter 45 The Affidavit So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book, and, indeed, as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm-whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this volume.

2
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:23,473
But the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon.

3
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:43,318
In order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds, I care not to perform this part of my task methodically, but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items, practically or reliably,

4
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:52,357
known to me as a whaleman, and from these citations I take it the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself.

5
00:00:52,577 --> 00:01:01,476
First, I have personally known three instances where a whale, after receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape.

6
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:14,503
And, after an interval, in one instance of three years, has been again struck by the same hand, and slain the two irons, both marked by the same private cipher, have been taken from the body.

7
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:45,064
In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons, and I think it may have been something more than that, the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident, to wander in the heart of unknown regions.

8
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:49,031
Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels.

9
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:57,747
No doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa, but to no purpose.

10
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,458
This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the other.

11
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:19,394
I say I myself have known three instances similar to this, that is, in two of them I saw the whale struck, and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish.

12
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:26,644
In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last,

13
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:36,138
and the last time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which I had observed there three years previous.

14
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,625
I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that.

15
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:53,805
Here are three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of, but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach.

16
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:55,467
Secondly,

17
00:02:55,447 --> 00:03:13,000
It is well known in the sperm-whale fishery, however ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognizable.

18
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:22,538
Why such a whale became thus marked, was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities, as distinguished from other whales.

19
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:35,241
Forever peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil.

20
00:03:35,491 --> 00:04:02,410
No, the reason was this, that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognize him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance.

21
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:19,217
Like some poor devils ashore, that happen to know an irascible great man, they make distant, unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest, if they pursue the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.

22
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:43,812
But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity, nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown, not only was he famous in life, and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a name, now had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar.

23
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:48,158
Was it not so, O Time or Tom, thou famed Leviathan,

24
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:57,429
scarred like an iceberg, who so long did slurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay.

25
00:04:57,469 --> 00:05:05,099
Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack, thou terror of all cruisers that cross their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land?

26
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:16,272
Was it not so, O Morquan, King of Japan, whose lofty jet, they say at times, assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?

27
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:23,585
Was it not so, O Don Miguel, thou Chilean whale, marked like an old tortoise, with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back?

28
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:32,782
In plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of cetacean history as Marius or Scylla to the classic scholar.

29
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,665
But this is not all.

30
00:05:34,645 --> 00:06:04,652
New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting out through the Narragansett woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Anawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.

31
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:24,092
I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe.

32
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:31,519
For this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error.

33
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:54,079
So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.

34
00:06:54,059 --> 00:07:07,734
Though most men have some vague, flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.

35
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:22,210
One reason, perhaps, is that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public record at home, however transient, and immediately forgotten that record.

36
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:36,974
Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding Leviathan dew?

37
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:45,328
You suppose that that poor fellow's name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast?

38
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:49,733
No, because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea.

39
00:07:50,654 --> 00:08:10,681
In fact, did you ever hear what—yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others, we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat's crew.

40
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:14,927
For God's sake, be ecumenical with your lamps and candles.

41
00:08:14,907 --> 00:08:20,196
Not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was spilled for it.

42
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:39,210
Secondly, Ednut, people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power, but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this twofold enormousness they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness.

43
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:48,759
Fourth, Elfin, I declare upon my soul I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.

44
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:56,967
But, fortunately, the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony, entirely independent of my own.

45
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:59,149
That point is this, court.

46
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:07,898
The sperm-whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing and judiciously malicious, as with direct forethought to stave in, utterly destroy,

47
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:10,241
and sink a large ship.

48
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:15,188
And what is more, a sperm-whale A. A. S. done it first in."

49
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:22,097
In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard of Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean.

50
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:27,324
One day she saw Spats lowered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm-whales.

51
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:36,636
Ere long, several of the whales were wounded, when suddenly a very large whale, escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal

52
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:39,023
and bore directly down upon the ship.

53
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:47,908
Dashing his forehead against her hold, he so stove her in that in less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over.

54
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:51,922
Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.

55
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:57,509
After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats.

56
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:03,857
Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship.

57
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:08,723
But the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers.

58
00:10:09,364 --> 00:10:12,748
For the second time his ship was utterly lost.

59
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:17,278
and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since.

60
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:20,826
At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket.

61
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:26,318
I have seen Owen Chase, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy.

62
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,725
I have read his plain and faithful narrative.

63
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:36,356
I have conversed with his son, and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.

64
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:37,758
It's— Footnote.

65
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,160
Chapter 1.

66
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:40,342
Part 2.

67
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:41,885
Chapter 12.

68
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,627
Footnote.

69
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:46,232
The following are extracts from Chase's narrative code.

70
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:51,160
Every fact seemed to warn me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations.

71
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,101
Code 2.

72
00:10:52,081 --> 00:11:06,514
Several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock, to effect which the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary.

73
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:11,979
His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury.

74
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:22,088
He came directly from the shawl which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.

75
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:38,558
Again, Carinia, at all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief,

76
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:46,812
on the part of the whale many of which impressions, I cannot now recall, induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion.

77
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:53,863
Here are his reflections, some time after quitting the ship, during a black night, an open boat,

78
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:57,789
when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore.

79
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:10,570
The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation.

80
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,435
seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought, thought.

81
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:25,931
The dismal-looking wreck, and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale, wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.

82
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:26,672
In another place P.

83
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:32,220
45-E speaks of the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal."

84
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:41,620
Secondly, the Ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807, totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset.

85
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:51,532
But the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter, though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it.

86
00:12:51,792 --> 00:13:08,839
Thirdly, some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J. Imarok, then commanding an American sloop of war of the first class, happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands.

87
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:20,414
Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical, touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentleman present.

88
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:29,405
He peremptorily denied, for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop of war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful.

89
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:32,970
Very good, but there is more coming.

90
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,844
some weeks after the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso.

91
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:45,559
But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm-whale that begged a few moments' confidential business with him.

92
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:58,111
That business consisted in fetching the Commodore's craft such a thrack, that with all his pumps going, he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair.

93
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:04,398
I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore's interview with that whale as providential.

94
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:09,704
Was not Sol of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright?

95
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:13,909
I tell you, the sperm-whale will stand no nonsense.

96
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:23,123
I will now refer you to Langsdorff's voyages, for a little circumstance and point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof.

97
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:34,259
Langsdorff, you must know, by the way, was attached to the Russian admiral Krusenstern's famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century.

98
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,766
Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter of, quote,

99
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:46,417
By the 13th of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ockage.

100
00:14:46,898 --> 00:15:03,302
The weather was very clear and fine, but so in-an uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,

101
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:11,211
which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him.

102
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:22,023
We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.

103
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:27,889
The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we, who were below all,

104
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:29,817
sprang instantly upon the deck.

105
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:38,571
Concluding that we had struck upon some rock, instead of this, we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity.

106
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:51,847
Captain de Wolfe applied immediately to the pumps, to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that, very happily, it had escaped entirely uninjured.

107
00:15:52,608 --> 00:16:07,731
Now, the Captain de Wolfe here alluded to as commanding the ship in question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston.

108
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:10,656
I have the honor of being a nephew of his.

109
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:15,783
I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorf.

110
00:16:16,484 --> 00:16:18,508
He substantiates every word.

111
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:31,187
The ship, however, was by no means a large one, a Russian craft, built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.

112
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:35,153
In that up-and-down manly book of old-fashioned adventure,

113
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:53,580
So full, too, of honest wonders the voyage of line or wafer, one of ancient Dampier's old chum's eye found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here, for a corroborative example, if such be needed.

114
00:16:54,016 --> 00:17:00,763
Lionel, it seems, was on his way to John Ferdinandum, as he calls the modern Juan Fernandez.

115
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:19,382
In our way thither, he says, about four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think,

116
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:22,187
But everyone began to prepare for death.

117
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:27,356
And indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted.

118
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,379
The ship had struck against a rock.

119
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,329
But when the amazement was a little over, we cast the lead and sounded.

120
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:37,011
but found no ground.

121
00:17:38,212 --> 00:17:44,337
The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.

122
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:49,142
Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin.

123
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:50,683
"'What?'

124
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:52,545
returned Bell Whitten.

125
00:17:52,565 --> 00:18:03,595
"'Lie and all, then,' goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time,

126
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:07,479
did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land.

127
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:20,191
But I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.

128
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:30,021
I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to me, of the great power and malice, at times, of the sperm whale.

129
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:44,380
In more than one instance he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.

130
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:59,400
The English ship Pusey Hall can tell a story on that head, and, as for his strength, let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm-whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship.

131
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:07,992
and secured there, the whole, the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.

132
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:23,312
Again, it is very often observed that, if the spurned whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage, as with willful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers.

133
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:36,695
Nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes.

134
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:46,212
But I must be content with only one more, and a concluding illustration, a remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see,

135
00:19:46,192 --> 00:20:06,327
that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels, like all marvels, are mere repetitions of the ages, so that for the millionth time we say Amen with solemn and verily there is nothing new under the sun.

136
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:16,381
In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was emperor and Belisarius general.

137
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:23,351
As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every way of uncommon value.

138
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:34,727
By the best authorities he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars

139
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:38,172
Not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.

140
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:58,538
Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmara, after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years.

141
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:06,071
A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid, nor is there any reason it should be.

142
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:20,577
Of what precise species this sea-monster was is not mentioned, but as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale, and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm-whale.

143
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:22,160
and I will tell you why.

144
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:31,358
For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean, and the deep waters connecting with it.

145
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:39,274
Even now I am certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things,

146
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:42,340
a place for his habitual gregarious resort.

147
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:53,279
But further investigations have recently proved to me that, in modern times, there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm-whale in the Mediterranean.

148
00:21:54,201 --> 00:22:03,658
I am told on good authority that on the Barbary coast a Commodore Davis of the British Navy found the skeleton of the sperm-whale.

149
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:14,689
Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm-whale could, by the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.

150
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:24,138
In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found, the element of the right whale.

151
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:30,844
But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm-whale-squid, or cuttlefish-lurks,

152
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:40,103
at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its surface."

153
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:59,683
If, then, you properly put these statements together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea monster, that for half a century, stove the ships of a Roman emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm whale.
