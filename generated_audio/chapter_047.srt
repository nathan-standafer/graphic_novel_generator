00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:05,683
Chapter 47 - The Matmaker. It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon.

2
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:11,735
The seamen were lazily lounging about the decks or vacantly gazing over into the lead-colored waters.

3
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:18,850
Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword mat for an additional lashing to our boat.

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:31,000
So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self.

5
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:57,780
I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat, as I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of Marlene between the long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy-oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn, I say so strange a dreaminess did there.

6
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:11,293
then rain all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the loom of time, and I myself were a shuttle, mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fates.

7
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:25,067
There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever-returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own.

8
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:33,956
This warp seemed necessity, and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads.

9
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:52,033
Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the wolf slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be, and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric,

10
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:58,801
This savage's sword, thought I, which thus finely shapes and fashions both warp and woof.

11
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:01,606
This easy, indifferent sword must be chance.

12
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:04,851
Aye, chance, free will, and necessity.

13
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:10,461
Now wise, incompatible, all interweavingly working together.

14
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:14,766
the straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course.

15
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:18,910
It's every alternating vibration, indeed only tending to that.

16
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:37,410
Free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads, and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring blow at events.

17
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:51,720
Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange, long drawn and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing.

18
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,115
High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad gay header Tashtego.

19
00:02:56,815 --> 00:03:03,481
His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hands stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries.

20
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:12,390
To be sure the same sound was that very moment, perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen's lookouts perched as high in the air.

21
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:20,037
But from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvelous cadence as from Tashtego the Indians.

22
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:33,453
As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate and by those wild cries announcing their coming.

23
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:37,999
There she blows, there, there, there, she blows, she blows.

24
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:38,960
Where?

25
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,005
Away, on the leebeam about two miles off, a school of them.

26
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:46,429
Instantly all was commotion.

27
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:56,491
The sperm whale blows of the clock ticks with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity, and thereby Whaleman distinguished this fish from other tribes of his genus.

28
00:03:57,392 --> 00:04:02,019
There go flukes, was now the cry from Tash to go, and the whales disappeared.

29
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,263
Quick, steward, cried Ahab.

30
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:05,585
Time, time!

31
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,787
Doh!

32
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:12,315
Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact minute to Ahab.

33
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,819
The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling before it.

34
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:24,688
Testigo reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows.

35
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:38,623
For that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills round and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter.

36
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:49,237
This deceitfulness of his could not now be in action, for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tash to go had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity.

37
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:58,570
One of the men selected for shipkeepers, that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main mast head.

38
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:12,095
The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down, the line tubs were fixed in their places, the cranes were thrust out, the main yard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three sampire baskets over high cliffs.

39
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:20,005
Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale.

40
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:26,093
So looked the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw themselves on board an enemy ship.

41
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:39,002
But at this critical instant, a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale, with a start all glared at Dark Ahab, who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh-formed out of air.
