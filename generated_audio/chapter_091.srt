Chapter 91 - The Pequod Meets the Rosebud.

2
00:00:01,694 --> 00:00:03,457
Chapter 91 - The Pequod Meets the Rosebud.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:11,071
In vain it was to rake for ambergris in the paunch of this leviathan, insufferable fetter denying not inquiry.

4
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,956
Sire T. Brownie, V.E.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:28,595
It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury midday sea, that the many noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft.

6
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:32,159
A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.

7
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:39,909
I will bet something now, said Stubb, that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day.

8
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,492
I thought they would keel up before long.

9
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:52,079
Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside, and there in the distance lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside.

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:01:08,479
As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colors from his peak, and by the eddying cloud of vulture seafowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale.

11
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:14,649
that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse.

12
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:25,827
It may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale, worse than an Assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed.

13
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:32,173
So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.

14
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:43,504
Yet are there those who will still do it, notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of Atar of Rose.

15
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:53,974
Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside, and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first.

16
00:01:53,954 --> 00:02:07,490
In truth, it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion, leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil.

17
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:18,763
Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun, blasted whales in general.

18
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:28,078
The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that Stubb vowed he recognized his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales.

19
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,646
There's a pretty fellow now, he banteringly laughed, standing in the ship's bows.

20
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:35,449
There's a jackal for ye.

21
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:45,645
I well know that these crappos of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery, sometimes lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for sperm-whale spouts, yes.

22
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:56,178
and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get won't be enough to dip the captain's wick into.

23
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:08,494
Ay, we all know these things, but look ye, here's a crapo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean, ay, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.

24
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:10,489
Poor devil, I say.

25
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,814
Pass round a hat, someone, and let's make him a present of a little oil for dear charity's sake.

26
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:22,501
For what oil he'll get from that drugged whale there wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail, no, not in a condemned cell.

27
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:32,591
And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than he'll get from that bundle of bones, though.

28
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,093
Now that I think of it,

29
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:37,176
It may contain something worth a good deal more than oil.

30
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,858
Yes, ambergris.

31
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,801
I wonder now if our old man has thought of that.

32
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:43,303
It's worth trying.

33
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:45,045
Yes, I'm for it."

34
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:48,028
And so saying, he started for the quarter-deck.

35
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:59,760
By this time the faint air had become a complete calm, so that whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again.

36
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,605
Issuing from the cabin, Stub now called his boat's crew and pulled off for the stranger.

37
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:24,027
Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stempiece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there, the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color.

38
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:35,279
Upon her headboards, in large gilt letters, he read, Boutin de Rose, Rosebutton, or Rosebud, and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.

39
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:45,110
Though Stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription, yet the word Rose and the bulbous figurehead put together sufficiently explained the whole to him.

40
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,032
A wooden rosebud, eh?

41
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:49,094
he cried with his hand to his nose.

42
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:53,659
That will do very well, but how like all creation it smells!

43
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:04,594
Now, in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the blasted whale, and so talk over it.

44
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:09,581
Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled.

45
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:11,865
Bouton de Rose, ahoy!

46
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:14,989
Are there any of you Bouton de Roses that speak English?

47
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,108
Yes, rejoined a Guernsey man from the bulwarks who turned out to be the chief mate.

48
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,375
Well then, my bouton de rosebud, have you seen the white whale?

49
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:25,417
What whale?

50
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:27,660
The white whale, a sperm whale.

51
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:29,784
Moby Dick, have you seen him?

52
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:31,507
Never heard of such a whale.

53
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,492
Cachalot Blanche, white whale, no.

54
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:36,295
Very good then.

55
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,340
Goodbye now, and I'll call again in a minute.

56
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:50,438
Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he molded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted, No, sir, no!

57
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,966
upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.

58
00:05:55,767 --> 00:06:04,062
He now perceived that the Guernsey man, who had just got into the chains and was using a cutting spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.

59
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,959
What's the matter with your nose there?"

60
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:06,759
said Stubb.

61
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,480
Broke it?

62
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:15,528
I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all, answered the Guernseyman, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much.

63
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,550
But what are you holding yours for?

64
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:19,152
Oh, nothing.

65
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:20,754
It's a wax nose.

66
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:21,695
I have to hold it on.

67
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:23,396
Fine day, ain't it?

68
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:28,462
Ere rather garden-eye, I should say, throw us a bunch of posies, will ye, Bouton de Rose?

69
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,384
What in the devil's name do you want here?

70
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,627
roared the Guernseyman, flying into a sudden passion.

71
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,462
Oh, keep cool?

72
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:36,143
Cool?

73
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:37,366
Yes, that's the word.

74
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:39,970
Why don't you pack those whales in ice while you're working at them?

75
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:46,462
But joking aside, though, do you know, Rosebud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales?

76
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:51,632
As for that dried-up one, there, he hasn't a gill in his whole carcass.

77
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:55,541
I know that well enough, but, Dicey, the captain here won't believe it.

78
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,306
This is his first voyage.

79
00:06:57,686 --> 00:06:59,631
He was a cologne manufacturer before.

80
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:06,347
But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't me, and so I'll get out of this dirty scrape.

81
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:13,169
Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow," rejoined Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.

82
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,613
There a queer scene presented itself.

83
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:21,144
The sailors, in tasseled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles and readiness for the whales.

84
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:26,614
But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor.

85
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:30,778
All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jibbooms.

86
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:36,244
Now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the masthead to get some fresh air.

87
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:42,370
Some thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coal tar and at intervals held it to their nostrils.

88
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:51,640
Others, having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco smoke so that it constantly filled their olfactories.

89
00:07:52,649 --> 00:08:04,029
Stub was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captain's roundhouse abaft, and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within.

90
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:16,311
This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the captain's roundhouse, cabinet he called it, to avoid the pest.

91
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:21,085
but still could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.

92
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:37,371
Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the Guernsey man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.

93
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:43,919
Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris.

94
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:59,477
He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.

95
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:13,571
According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey man, under cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb, and as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.

96
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,314
By this time, their destined victim appeared from his cabin.

97
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:29,346
He was a small and dark, but rather delicate-looking man for a sea captain, with large whiskers and mustache, however, and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch seals at his side.

98
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:38,374
To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey man, who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.

99
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,100
What shall I say to him first?"

100
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,801
said he.

101
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,002
Why?

102
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:45,427
said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals.

103
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:51,995
You may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge.

104
00:09:52,816 --> 00:10:06,454
He says, monsieur, said the Guernseyman, in French, turning to his captain, that only yesterday his ship spoke of vessel whose captain and chief mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside.

105
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:10,551
Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.

106
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:11,793
What now?

107
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:13,576
said the Guernsey man to Stubb.

108
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:22,271
Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a whale-ship than a St.

109
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,052
Jago monkey.

110
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:26,518
In fact, tell him from me he's a baboon.

111
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:32,725
He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is far more deadly than the blasted one.

112
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:38,172
In fine, Monsieur, he conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish."

113
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:49,566
Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting tackles, and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.

114
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:50,707
What now?

115
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:54,852
said the Guernsey man, when the captain had returned to them.

116
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:59,036
Why, let me see, yes, you may as well tell him now that, that.

117
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:04,061
In fact, tell him I've diddled him, and aside to himself, perhaps somebody else.

118
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:08,926
He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service to us.

119
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:19,456
Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties, meaning himself and mate, and concluded by inviting Stub down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.

120
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:23,640
He wants you to take a glass of wine with him, said the interpreter.

121
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:28,747
Thank him heartily, but tell him it's against my principles to drink with the man I've diddled.

122
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,050
In fact, tell him I must go.

123
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:46,287
He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking, but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales, for it's so calm they won't drift.

124
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:58,710
By this time, Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat hailed the Guernseyman to this effect, that having a long towline in his boat, he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.

125
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:10,001
While the Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long towline.

126
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:12,443
Presently, a breeze sprang up.

127
00:12:12,423 --> 00:12:22,156
Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale, hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale.

128
00:12:23,017 --> 00:12:33,230
Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning.

129
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:40,540
Seizing his sharp boat spade, he commenced an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.

130
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:53,508
You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea, and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.

131
00:12:54,430 --> 00:13:01,583
His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as gold hunters.

132
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:08,639
And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.

133
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:29,460
Stub was beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nose-gay increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for a time.

134
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,301
"'I have it!

135
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:31,283
I have it!'

136
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:35,169
cried Stubb with delight, striking something in the subterranean regions.

137
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,150
"'A purse!

138
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:37,172
A purse!'

139
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:49,390
Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of something that looked like rife Windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese, very unctuous and savory withal.

140
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,393
You might easily dent it with your thumb.
