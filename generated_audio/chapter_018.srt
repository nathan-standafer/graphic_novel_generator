00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:24,960
CHAPTER XVIII HIS MARK As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg, in his gruff voice, loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers.

2
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,523
What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?

3
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:32,608
said I, now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.

4
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:37,373
"'I mean,' he replied, "'he must show his papers.'

5
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:45,081
"'Yes,' said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind Peleg's out of the wigwam.

6
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:47,264
"'He must show that he's converted.

7
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:50,767
Son of darkness,' he added, turning to Queequeg.

8
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,452
"'Art thou at present in communion with any Christian church?'

9
00:00:56,596 --> 00:01:00,546
Why," said I, he's a member of the First Congregational Church.

10
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:07,905
Here be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.

11
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:12,106
first congregational church," cried Bildad.

12
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:17,233
"'What that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?'

13
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:32,813
And so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandanna-handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.

14
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,352
How long hath he been a member?"

15
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:39,398
he then said, turning to me, not very long.

16
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,423
I rather guess, young man.

17
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:50,503
No, said Pellag, and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it would have washed some of that devil's blue off his face.

18
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:53,670
To tell now, cried Bildad.

19
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,717
Is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting?

20
00:01:58,298 --> 00:02:01,724
I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord's Day."

21
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:06,833
"'I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,' said Inoes.

22
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:12,343
That Kwekwek here is a born member of the First Congregational Church.

23
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:15,709
He is a deacon himself, Kwekwek is."

24
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:23,138
"'Young man,' said Bildad sternly, "'thou art sky-larking with me, explain thyself, thou young Hittite.

25
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:24,359
What church dost thee mean?

26
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:25,401
Answer me.'

27
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:45,004
Finding myself thus hard-pushed, I replied, "'I mean, sir, the same ancient Catholic church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul of us, belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world.

28
00:02:44,984 --> 00:02:47,608
We all belong to that call.

29
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,817
Some of us cherish some queer cratchits, No ways touching the grand belief.

30
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:56,383
Chin, a tee, and thee, all join hands.

31
00:02:56,704 --> 00:03:01,292
Splice thou mean splice hands, cried Peleg, drawing nearer.

32
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:07,482
Young man, you'd better ship for a missionary, Instead of a foremast hand, either.

33
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:09,185
Never heard a better sermon.

34
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:11,530
Deacon Deuteronomy, why?

35
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,497
Father Mapple himself couldn't beat it, and he's reckoned something.

36
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:18,422
Come aboard, come aboard, never mind about the papers.

37
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:26,938
I say, tell Quahog there—what's that you call him?—tell Quahog to step along, by the great anchor.

38
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:28,760
What a harpoon he's got there.

39
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:30,683
Looks like good stuff, that.

40
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:32,886
And he handles it about right.

41
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:38,753
I say, Quahog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat?

42
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:40,836
Did you ever strike a fish?

43
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:47,104
Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the bulwarks.

44
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:59,202
From thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side, and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon, cried out in some such way as this, "'Copaine!

45
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:02,506
You see him small drop tar on water, dare?

46
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,249
You see him?'

47
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,355
Well, spose I'm one way lie, well, din!"

48
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:18,671
And taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean across the ship's decks, and struck the glistening tar-spot out of sight.

49
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,457
"'Now,' said Queak-Quake, quietly hauling in the line,

50
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:26,603
Spose ye him, whaley I, Why, dad whale dead!"

51
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:35,776
Quick, Bildad," said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.

52
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:40,142
Quick, I say you, Bildad, and get the ship's papers.

53
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:44,748
We must have Hedgehog there—I mean Quahog in one of our boats.

54
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:53,120
Look ye, Quahog, we'll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that's more than ever was given a harpoonier yet out of Nantucket."

55
00:04:53,140 --> 00:05:02,653
So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.

56
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:10,186
When all preliminaries were over, and Peleg had got everything ready for signing, he turned to me and said, I guess.

57
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:13,550
Quahog, there don't know how to write, does he?

58
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:16,455
I say, Quahog, blast ye.

59
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:19,158
Dost thou sign thy name, or make thy mark?

60
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:32,117
But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed at taking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place,

61
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:45,815
An exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm, so that, through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like this quahog.

62
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:47,137
His S-mark.

63
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:59,674
Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at last, rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracks and, selecting one entitled

64
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:17,196
The latter day coming, or no time to lose, placed it in Quixote's hands, and then, grasping them in the book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, Son of darkness, I must do my duty by the latter day coming earned of this ship, and feel concern for the souls of all its crew, if thou still clingest to thy pagas, I must.

65
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:27,889
Spurned the idle bell, and the hideous dragon turned from the wrath, to come thine eye, I say, O goodness gracious, steer clear of the fiery pit.

66
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:36,484
something of the salt sea, yet lingered in old Bildad's language, heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases.

67
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:42,775
Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer, Peleg.

68
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:47,603
Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers, it takes the shark out of him.

69
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:51,430
No harpooneer is worth a straw who ain't pretty sharkish.

70
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,544
There was young Nat Swain, once the bravest boatheader out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard.

71
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:01,449
He joined the meeting and never came to good.

72
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:12,490
He got so frightened about his plaguey soul that he shrinked and sheared away from Wales for fear of afterclaps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.

73
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:13,589
Pelleg!

74
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:14,671
Pelleg!"

75
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,195
said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands.

76
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:22,324
Thou thyself, as I am myself, hast seen many a perilous time.

77
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:25,990
Thou knowest, Pelleg, what it is to have the fear of death.

78
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:29,476
How, then, canst thou prate in this ungodly guise?

79
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,263
Thou beliest thine own heart, Pelleg."

80
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:46,741
When this same Pequod here had her three masts Overboard in that typhoon on Japan, That same voyage when thou went to mate With Captain Ahab, didst thou not think Of death and the judgment then?

81
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,482
"'Hear him!

82
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:48,764
hear him now!'

83
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:55,192
cried Peleg, Marching across the cabin, and thrusting His hands far down into his pockets.

84
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:56,654
"'Hear him, all of ye!

85
00:07:56,694 --> 00:08:00,499
think of that, When every moment we thought the ship would sink,

86
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:02,411
Death and the judgment, then?

87
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:04,015
What?

88
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:14,585
With all three masts making Such an everlasting thundering against the sigh, And every sea breaking over us fore and aft, Think of death and the judgment, then?

89
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:15,788
No.

90
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:18,332
No time to think about death then.

91
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:30,952
Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of, and how to save all hands, how to rig jury-masts, how to get into the nearest port—it—that was what I was thinking of."

92
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:36,681
Bill died, said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we followed him.

93
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:43,952
There he stood, very quietly overlooking some seymakers who were mending a top-sail in the waste.

94
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:52,002
Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been wasted.
