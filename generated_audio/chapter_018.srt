00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:20,458
Chapter 18 His Mark As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers.

2
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,322
What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?

3
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:28,169
said I, now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.

4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,533
I mean, he replied, he must show his papers.

5
00:00:32,635 --> 00:00:38,863
Yes, said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind Pelegs out of the wigwam.

6
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:41,387
He must show that he's converted.

7
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:49,798
Son of Darkness, he added, turning to Kwekweg, art thou at present in communion with any Christian church?

8
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:53,732
Why, said I, he's a member of the First Congregational Church.

9
00:00:54,613 --> 00:01:01,287
Here be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.

10
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,814
First Congregational Church, cried Bildad.

11
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:09,002
What, that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting house?

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:21,432
And so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.

13
00:01:21,972 --> 00:01:23,373
How long hath he been a member?

14
00:01:23,794 --> 00:01:25,175
he then said, turning to me.

15
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:27,898
Not very long, I rather guess, young man.

16
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:35,665
No, said Peleg, and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it would have washed some of that devil's blue off his face.

17
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:37,467
"'Do tell now,' cried Bildad.

18
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:41,233
"'Is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting?

19
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:44,717
I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord's Day.'"

20
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,803
"'I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,' said I.

21
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:54,350
"'All I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church.

22
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:57,134
He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.'"

23
00:01:57,154 --> 00:02:02,361
"'Young man,' said Bildad sternly, "'thou art skylarking with me.

24
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,526
Explain thyself, thou young Hittite.

25
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:06,369
What church dost thee mean?

26
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,211
Answer me."

27
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:22,543
Finding myself thus hard-pushed, I replied, I mean Sir, the same ancient Catholic church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul of us belong,

28
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:27,010
the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world.

29
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:28,773
We all belong to that.

30
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,537
Only some of us cherish some queer crotchets.

31
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:33,680
No way's touching the grand belief.

32
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:36,285
In THH all join hands.

33
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:37,927
Splice!

34
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:42,074
Thou mean'st splice hands, cried Peleg, drawing nearer.

35
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:46,741
Young man, you'd better ship for a missionary instead of a four-mast hand.

36
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:48,384
I never heard a better sermon.

37
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:50,607
Deacon Deuteronomy,

38
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,252
Why, Father Mapple himself couldn't beat it, And he's reckoned something.

39
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:57,876
Come aboard, come aboard, Never mind about the papers.

40
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:00,319
I say, tell Quollhog there.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,041
What's that you call him?

42
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:04,044
Tell Quollhog to step along.

43
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:07,067
By the great anchor, What a harpoon he's got there.

44
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:10,772
Looks like good stuff, that, And he handles it about right.

45
00:03:10,752 --> 00:03:15,819
I say, Quillhog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head of a whaleboat?

46
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,381
Did you ever strike a fish?

47
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:31,680
Without saying a word, Queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats hanging to the side, and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon, cried out in some such way as this,

48
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,883
Cap'n, you see him small drop tar on water, dare?

49
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:35,884
You see him?

50
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,206
Well, spose him one whale-eye.

51
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:39,147
Well, den."

52
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:49,998
And taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean across the ship's decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.

53
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:55,523
Now, said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, spose him whale-eye.

54
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,025
Why, dad whale dead.

55
00:03:57,746 --> 00:03:59,187
Quick, Bildad.

56
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:06,218
Said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.

57
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:09,784
Quick, I say, you build ad, and get the ship's papers.

58
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:14,712
We must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quahog, in one of our boats.

59
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:22,132
Look ye, Quahog, we'll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that's more than ever was given a harpooner yet out of Nantucket."

60
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:29,713
So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.

61
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:39,326
When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing, he turned to me and said, I guess, Quohog, there don't know how to write, does he?

62
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:45,222
I say, Quohog, Blasgy, dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark?

63
00:04:45,202 --> 00:05:07,832
But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed, but taking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm, so that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like this.

64
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:11,597
Quohog, his X mark.

65
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:32,623
Meanwhile, Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at last, rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracks, and selecting one entitled The Latter Day Coming or No Time to Lose, placed it in Queequeg's hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,

66
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:37,873
looked earnestly into his eyes and said, Son of Darkness, I must do my duty by thee.

67
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:42,182
I am part owner of this ship and feel concern for the souls of all its crew.

68
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:49,937
If thou still clingest to thy pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for I a Belial bondsman.

69
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:55,067
Spurn the idle bell and the hideous dragon, Turn from the wrath to come, mind thine eye.

70
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:59,597
I say, O, goodness gracious, steer clear of the fiery pit.

71
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:08,635
Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's language, heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases.

72
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:11,261
Avast there, avast there, Bildad.

73
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:14,328
Avast now spoiling our harpooneer, Peleg.

74
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:17,395
Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers.

75
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,079
It takes the shark out of them.

76
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,386
No harpooneer is worth a straw who ain't pretty sharkish.

77
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:24,531
There was young Nat Swain.

78
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,646
Once the bravest boatheader out of all Nantucket and the vineyard, he joined the meeting and never came to good.

79
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:41,473
He got so frightened about his plaguey soul that he shrinked and sheared away from Wales for fear of afterclaps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.

80
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:42,035
Pelag.

81
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:51,003
Pelag, said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, thou thyself, as I myself, has seen many a perilous time.

82
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:55,176
Thou knowest, Pelag, what it is to have the fear of death.

83
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:58,219
How then canst thou prate in this ungodly guise?

84
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,883
Thou belliest thine own heart, Pelag.

85
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:12,962
Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, didst thou not think of death and the judgment then?

86
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:14,604
"'Hear him, hear him now!'

87
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:19,489
cried Peleg, marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets.

88
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,071
"'Hear him, all of ye!

89
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:24,575
Think of that, when every moment we thought the ship would sink!

90
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:26,697
Death and the judgment then?

91
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:27,538
What?

92
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:36,088
With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side, and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft!

93
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:38,811
Think of death and the judgment then!

94
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:42,595
No, no time to think about death then!

95
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:53,736
Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of, and how to save all hands, how to rig jury masts, how to get into the nearest port—that was what I was thinking of."

96
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:59,324
Bildad said no more, but, buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck where we followed him.

97
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:05,033
There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top sail in the waste.

98
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:11,704
Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted.
