CHAPTER XXVI.

2
00:00:01,633 --> 00:00:09,463
NIGHTS AND SQUIRES The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent.

3
00:00:10,364 --> 00:00:16,832
He was a long, earnest man, and, though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes.

4
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:24,521
His flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale.

5
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:29,447
He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine,

6
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:34,194
or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous.

7
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:52,039
Only some thirty errant summers had he seen, those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness, but this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight.

8
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,743
It was merely the condensation of the man,

9
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:58,348
He was by no means ill-looking, quite the contrary.

10
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:24,240
His pure tight skin was an excellent fit, and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified Egyptian, this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as now, for be it polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates.

11
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:33,163
Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousandfold perils he had calmly confronted through life.

12
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:43,225
A staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds.

13
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:55,187
Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.

14
00:01:55,708 --> 00:02:07,305
Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition.

15
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:17,088
Quote to that sort of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.

16
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:25,547
Outward portents and inward presentiments were his, and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul,

17
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:50,631
Much more did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.

18
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:53,914
"'I will have no man in my boat,' said Starba.

19
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,290
who is not afraid of a whale.

20
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:12,731
By this he seemed to mean, not only, that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.

21
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,416
"'Ay, ay,' said Stubb, the second mate.

22
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:22,264
"'Starbuck, there is as careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery.

23
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:31,245
But we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or almost any other whale-hunter.

24
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:34,209
Starbuck was no crusader after perils in him.

25
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:42,662
Courage was not a sentiment, but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions.

26
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:51,255
Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship.

27
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:56,042
like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted.

28
00:03:56,062 --> 00:04:06,318
Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sundown, nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him.

29
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:12,467
For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living.

30
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:18,755
and not to be killed by them for theirs, and that hundreds of men had been so killed, Starbuck well knew.

31
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:21,698
What doom was his own father's!

32
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:27,625
Where, in the buttonless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?

33
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:42,403
With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain superstitiousness, as has been said, the courage of this Starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish, must indeed have been extreme.

34
00:04:42,383 --> 00:05:05,792
But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had, hadâ€”it was not in nature that these things should fail in blatantly engendering an element in him which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its confinement and burn all his courage up.

35
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:22,583
and brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world,

36
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:33,138
yet cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.

37
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:50,443
But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to write it, for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the fall of valour in the soul.

38
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:56,698
Men may seem detestable as joint stock companies and nations, knaves, fools, and murderers there may be.

39
00:05:56,758 --> 00:06:00,146
Mean may have mean and meager faces.

40
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:07,403
But man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature.

41
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:13,909
that over any ignominious blemish in him, all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes.

42
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:29,623
That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact, though all the outer character, seen gone, bleds with keenest anguish at the undraved spectacle of a valour-ruined man.

43
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:37,390
Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars.

44
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:46,563
But this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture.

45
00:06:47,004 --> 00:07:06,111
Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wheels a pick or drives a spike, that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God Himself, the great God Absolute, the centre and circumference of all democracy, His omnipresence, our divine equality.

46
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:35,997
If, then, to meanest mariners And renegades and castaways, I shall hereafter Ascribe high qualities, though dark we round them, Tragic races, if even the most mournful, Perchance the most abased among them all, Shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts, Malts, if I shall touch that workman's arm With some ethereal light, if it shall spread a rainbow Over his disastrous set of sun, then, Mane as all mortal critics, bear me out in it, Thou just spirit of equality, which hast spread One royal mantle of humanity over all my kind

47
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:52,348
Bear me out in it, thou great democratic god, Who didst not refuse to the sweet convict, Bunyan, the pale poetic pearl, Thou who didst clove with doubly hammered leaves Of finest gold, the stumped and poppered arm Of old Cervantes.

48
00:07:53,459 --> 00:08:11,434
Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles, Who didst hurl him upon a war-horse, Who didst thunder him higher than a throne, Thou who, in all thy mighty earthly marchings, Ever cullest thy selectest champions from the kingly commons, Bar me out in it, O God!
