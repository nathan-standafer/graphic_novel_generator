00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:06,040
Chapter 64 - Stubbs' Supper. Stubbs' whale had been killed some distance from the ship.

2
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:12,750
It was a calm, so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.

3
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:24,267
And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea,

4
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:27,993
And it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals.

5
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:32,420
Good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved.

6
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:43,599
For, upon the great canal of Hanghou, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the footpath will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour.

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,849
But this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig lead in bulk.

8
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:59,689
Darkness came on, but three lights up and down in the Pequod's main rigging dimly guided our way, till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks.

9
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:11,533
Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning.

10
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:30,273
Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity to call it so, yet now that the creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed working in him, as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain.

11
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:38,162
And though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac object.

12
00:01:38,142 --> 00:01:49,772
Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod's decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep, for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the portholes.

13
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:54,294
but by those clanking links the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored.

14
00:01:55,115 --> 00:02:05,531
Tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessels, and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft.

15
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:12,621
The two ship and whale seem yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.

16
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:59,618
The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside is by the flukes or tail, and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the side fins, its flexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface, so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it.

17
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,362
But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome.

18
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:10,432
A small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.

19
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:28,356
By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit, and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.

20
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:40,589
If Moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on deck, Stub, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed in unusual but still good-natured excitement.

21
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:50,547
Such an unwanted bustle was he in that, the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs.

22
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:56,459
One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb was soon made strangely manifest.

23
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,742
Stubb was a high liver.

24
00:03:58,182 --> 00:04:02,130
He was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.

25
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:04,896
A steak, a steak, ere I sleep.

26
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:09,345
You, Dagoo, overboard you go, and cut me one from his small.

27
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:33,831
Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war, at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage, yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stub, comprising the tapering extremity of the body.

28
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:38,755
About midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil.

29
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:45,103
Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan head, as if that capstan were a sideboard.

30
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,847
Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night.

31
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:59,380
Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.

32
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:07,275
The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers' hearts.

33
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:21,329
Peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them, wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head.

34
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:25,873
This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous.

35
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:36,209
How at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universal problem of all things.

36
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:44,588
The mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.

37
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:56,400
Though amid all the smoking horror and scythe-stacks, like stack-slash-shove, like hungry dogs round a tassel where their red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them.

38
00:05:56,781 --> 00:06:10,204
And though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibly carving each other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasseled, the sharks also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat.

39
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:15,210
And though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing.

40
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,935
That is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties.

41
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:24,883
And those sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting.

42
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:34,335
If you have never seen that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil worship and the expediency of conciliating the devil.

43
00:06:34,315 --> 00:06:39,821
But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him.

44
00:06:40,262 --> 00:06:44,026
No more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips.

45
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:45,107
Cook!

46
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:45,628
Cook!

47
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:46,949
Where's that old fleece?

48
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:58,343
He cried at length, widening his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper, and, at the same time, darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing with his lance.

49
00:06:59,003 --> 00:06:59,684
Cook, you cook!

50
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,386
Sail this way, cook!

51
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:16,607
The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep.

52
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:27,978
Well scoured like his other pans, this old fleece, as they called him, came shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops.

53
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:41,431
This old ebony floundered along, and, in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb's sideboard, when, with both hands folded before him and resting on his two-legged cane, he bent.

54
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:45,835
Cook, said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth.

55
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:47,998
Don't you think this steak is rather overdone?

56
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,542
You've been beating this steak too much, cook.

57
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:51,303
It's too tender.

58
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:53,626
Don't I always say that to be good?

59
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,408
A whale steak must be tough.

60
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,832
There are those sharks now over the side.

61
00:07:58,032 --> 00:07:59,835
Don't you see they prefer it tough and rare?

62
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,138
What a shindy they are kicking up.

63
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:04,381
Cook, go and talk to them.

64
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:10,810
Tell them they are welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation, but they must keep quiet.

65
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,913
Blast me, if I can hear my own voice.

66
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:15,616
Away, cook, and deliver my message.

67
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:19,561
Here, take this lantern, snatching one from his sideboard.

68
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:22,125
Now then, go and preach to him.

69
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:32,258
Sullenly taking the offered lantern, Old Fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks, and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the sea,

70
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:34,582
so as to get a good view of his congregation.

71
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:47,884
With the other hand, he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice, began addressing the sharks, while Stub, softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.

72
00:08:47,864 --> 00:08:52,778
Fellow Critters, I'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat damn noise dere.

73
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:53,460
You hear?

74
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:55,686
Stop dat damn smackin' of da lips.

75
00:08:56,128 --> 00:09:02,987
Massa Stubs say dat you can fill you damn bellies up to da hatchings, but by gore, you must stop dat damn racket.

76
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,565
Cook, hear interposed Stubb accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder.

77
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:11,650
Cook, why, damn your eyes, you mustn't swear that way when you're preaching.

78
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,772
That's no way to convert sinners, Cook.

79
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:14,954
Who dat?

80
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:18,318
Den preach to him yourself, sullenly turning to go.

81
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,660
No, Cook, go on, go on.

82
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:25,726
Well, Den, belubed fellow critters, write, exclaimed Stubb approvingly.

83
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:29,110
Coax him to it, try that, and Fleece continued.

84
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:42,457
Do you, is all sharks, and by nature, wary, voracious, Yet I say to you, fellow critters, dat dat voraciousness, Top dat dam slappin' ob da tail, How you tink to here, suppose you keep up Such a dam slappin' and bitin' dare.

85
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:48,128
Cook, cried Stub, collaring him, I won't have that swearing, Talk to him gentlemanly.

86
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:58,825
Once more the sermon proceeded, Your voraciousness, fellow critters, I don't blame you so much for, Dot is notter and can't be helped, But to gobern dot wicked notter, Dot is de pint.

87
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:04,153
You is sharks, Sarton, But if you gobern de shark in you, Why den you be angel?

88
00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:07,939
For all angel is notting more, Dan de shark well goberned.

89
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,249
Now look here, brethren, just try once to be seeble, a-helping yourselves from dat whale.

90
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,495
Don't be tearin' to blubber out your neighbor's mout, I say.

91
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,661
Is not one shark dude right as toter to dat whale?

92
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:23,368
And, by gore, none on you has de right to dat whale.

93
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:25,211
Dat whale belong to someone else.

94
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:29,539
I know some o' you has Barry Brigg mout, Brigger Dan odors.

95
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,625
But den de brig mout sometimes has de small bellies.

96
00:10:33,026 --> 00:10:41,943
So, dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid, but to bid off de blubber for de small fry of sharks dat can't get into de scrooge to help demselves."

97
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:44,788
Well done, old fleece," cried Stubb.

98
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:46,091
That's Christianity.

99
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:47,393
Go on.

100
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:52,889
No use goin' on, the damn willins will keep a-scougin' and slappin' each odor, Massa Stubb.

101
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:54,372
They don't hear one word.

102
00:10:54,833 --> 00:11:01,787
No use a-preachin' to such damn guttons as you call them, till their bellies is full and their bellies is bottomless.

103
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:11,920
And when they do get them full, they won't hear you then, For then they sink in the sea, go fast to sleep on the coral, And can't hear noting at all, no more, for ever and eber.

104
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:19,894
Upon my soul I am about of the same opinion, So give the benediction, fleece, and I'll away to my supper.

105
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:32,493
Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his shrill voice and cried, Cust, fellow critters, kick up to damnedest row as ever you can, fill you damn bellies till they bust and den die.

106
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:36,679
Now cook, said Stub, resuming his supper at the capstan.

107
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,806
Stand just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular attention.

108
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:47,755
All dention, said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired position.

109
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:53,867
"'Well,' said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile, "'I shall now go back to the subject of the steak.

110
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,070
"'In the first place, how old are you, cook?'

111
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,772
"'What dat do with da talk?'

112
00:11:57,952 --> 00:11:59,334
said the old black testily.

113
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:00,355
"'Silence!

114
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:01,776
How old are you, cook?'

115
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:04,520
"'Bout ninety, they say,' he gloomily muttered.

116
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,587
"'And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook, "'and don't know yet how to cook a whale steak?'

117
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:17,134
Rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word, "'so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question.

118
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:18,275
Where were you born, Cook?

119
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:20,838
Hindah Hatchway, in ferryboat.

120
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,640
Going over to Roanoke.

121
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:24,522
Born in a ferryboat?

122
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:25,663
That's queer, too.

123
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:28,946
But I want to know what country you were born in, Cook.

124
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:31,549
Didn't I say to Roanoke country?

125
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:32,790
He cried sharply.

126
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:34,572
No, you didn't, Cook.

127
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:37,195
But I'll tell you what I'm coming to, Cook.

128
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,257
You must go home and be born over again.

129
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:42,160
You don't know how to cook a whale steak yet.

130
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,937
Breast my soul, if I cook noter one," he growled angrily, turning round to depart.

131
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:48,339
Come back here, cook.

132
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,761
Here, hand me those tongs.

133
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:54,388
Now take that bit of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be.

134
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:56,190
Take it, I say.

135
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,916
Holding the tongs towards him, take it and taste it.

136
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:08,369
Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro muttered, best-cooked hick-eye eber taste, juicy, berry juicy.

137
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,353
Juicy, berry juicy.

138
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,035
"'Cook,' said Stubb, squaring himself once more.

139
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:15,797
"'Do you belong to the church?'

140
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:20,001
"'Passed one once in Cape Town,' said the old man sullenly.

141
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:31,131
"'And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape Town, where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, Cook?

142
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:36,096
And yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?'

143
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:37,277
said Stubb.

144
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:39,619
"'Where do you expect to go to, Cook?'

145
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:44,321
Go to bed very soon," he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.

146
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:45,883
Avast!

147
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:46,924
Heave to!

148
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:50,508
I mean, when you die, Cook, it's an awful question.

149
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:51,790
Now what's your answer?

150
00:13:52,851 --> 00:14:02,642
When this old brack man dies, said the negro slowly, changing his whole air and demeanor, he hisself won't go nowhere, but some breast angel will come and fetch him.

151
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:04,044
Fetch him?

152
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:04,705
How?

153
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:07,408
In a coach and four as they fetched Elijah.

154
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:09,370
And fetch him where?

155
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:14,711
"'Up, dear,' said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and keeping it there very solemnly.

156
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:19,536
"'So, then, you expect to go up into our main top, do you, Cook, when you are dead?

157
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:22,700
But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?

158
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,001
Main top, eh?'

159
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:27,365
"'Didn't say datal,' said Fleece, again in the sulks.

160
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:29,147
"'You said up there, didn't you?

161
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:32,691
And now look yourself, and see where your tongs are pointing.'

162
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:37,501
But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lover's hole, cook.

163
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:43,554
But, no, no, cook, you don't get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging.

164
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:47,823
It's a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no go.

165
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:50,629
But none of us are in heaven yet.

166
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:53,033
Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders.

167
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:54,255
Do you hear?

168
00:14:54,315 --> 00:15:00,224
Hold your hat in one hand and clap tether atop of your heart when I'm giving my orders, cook.

169
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:02,628
What, that your heart, there?

170
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:07,075
That's your gizzard, aloft, aloft, that's it, now you have it.

171
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,900
Hold it there now and pay attention.

172
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:18,669
"'All dention,' said the old black, with both hands placed as desired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time.

173
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,210
"'Well, then, cook.

174
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:26,316
You see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible.

175
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:27,798
You see that, don't you?

176
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:37,828
Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for my private table here, the Capstan, I'll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing.'

177
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:41,215
Hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to it with the other.

178
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:42,056
That done.

179
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:43,379
Dish it, die here.

180
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,623
And now tomorrow, cook.

181
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:51,395
When we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins, have them put in pickle.

182
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:54,621
As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused, cook.

183
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:56,745
There, now ye may go.

184
00:15:57,637 --> 00:16:01,001
But Fleece had hardly got three paces off when he was recalled.

185
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:04,325
Cook, give me cutlets for supper tomorrow night in the mid-watch.

186
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:05,106
D'you hear?

187
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:06,467
Away you sail then.

188
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:09,291
Haloa, stop, make a bow before you go.

189
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:11,153
Avast, heaving again.

190
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:13,856
Whale balls for breakfast, don't forget.

191
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:17,560
Wish by gore, whale eat him, stead of him eat whale.

192
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:25,990
I'm breast if he ain't more of Sharkdan Massashark hisself, muttered the old man, limping away, with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.
