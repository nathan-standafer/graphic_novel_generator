Chapter 63, The Crotch.

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,024
Out of the trunk the branches grow, out of them the twigs.

3
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:22,031
So, inproductive subjects grow the chapters.

4
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,802
The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.

5
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:51,034
It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon, whose other... Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.

6
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:58,624
It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.

7
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:05,831
But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the line.

8
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:09,845
The object being this, to dart them both, if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale.

9
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:13,457
So that if, in the coming drag, one- It is a doubling of the chance-

10
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:25,036
But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooner, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him.

11
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:36,576
Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere, else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands.

12
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:37,518
tumbled into the water.

13
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:47,377
It accordingly is, in such cases, the spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.

14
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:53,569
But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.

15
00:01:54,511 --> 00:02:06,630
Furthermore, you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly crevetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines or cutting them and making a prodigious sense

16
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:13,325
nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until Woodhull is fairly captured and a corpse.

17
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:19,593
Consider now how it must be in the case of four boats, all engaging one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale.

18
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:26,481
When owing to these qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be.

19
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:35,031
For, of course, each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend onto the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery.

20
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:44,211
All these particulars are faithfully narrated here as they will not fail to elucidate several most important, however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be painted.
