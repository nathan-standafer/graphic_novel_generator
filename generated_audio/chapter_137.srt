00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:17,162
Chapter 135 - The Chase-Third Day. The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary nightman at the four-mast head was relieved by crowds of the daylight lookouts who dotted every mast and almost every spar.

2
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,921
"'Diceum?'

3
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:20,805
cried Ahab, but the whale was not yet in sight.

4
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:24,571
"'In his infallible wake, though, but follow that wake, that's all.

5
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:28,196
"'Helm there, steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.

6
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:29,898
"'What a lovely day again!

7
00:00:29,918 --> 00:00:36,268
"'We're at a new-made world, and made for a summer house to the angels, "'and this morning the first of its throwing open to them.

8
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:39,252
"'A fairer day could not dawn upon that world.'"

9
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:41,657
Here's food for thought, had Ahab time to think.

10
00:00:41,837 --> 00:00:42,939
But Ahab never thinks.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,084
He only feels, feels, feels.

12
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:48,571
That's tingling enough for mortal man, to think's audacity.

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,176
God only has that right and privilege.

14
00:00:51,957 --> 00:01:00,835
Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness, and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for that.

15
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:05,087
And yet I've sometimes thought my brain was very calm, frozen calm.

16
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:11,134
This old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turn to ice and shiver it.

17
00:01:11,674 --> 00:01:16,439
And still this hair is growing now, this moment growing, and heat must breed it.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:26,029
But no, it's like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava.

19
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:27,647
how the wild winds blow it.

20
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:33,558
They whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to.

21
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:46,262
A vile wind that has no doubt blown air this through prison corridors and cells and wards of hospitals and ventilated them and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.

22
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:48,164
Out upon it, it's tainted.

23
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:52,969
Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world.

24
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,073
I'd crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there.

25
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:59,977
And yet, tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind.

26
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:04,622
Whoever conquered it, in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow.

27
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:08,246
Run tilting at it, and you, but run through it.

28
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:09,387
Ha!

29
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:15,574
A coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.

30
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:19,482
Even Ahab is a braver thing, a nobler thing than that.

31
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:26,430
Would now the wind but had a body, but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man.

32
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:32,177
All these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as agents.

33
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:37,623
There's a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference.

34
00:02:38,564 --> 00:02:45,392
And yet I say again, and swear it now, that there's something all-glorious and gracious in the wind.

35
00:02:45,372 --> 00:03:04,630
These warm trade winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness, and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippis of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last.

36
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:20,461
And by the eternal poles, These same trades that so directly blow my good ship on, These trades, or something like them, Something so unchangeable and full as strong, Blow my keeled soul along, To it, aloft there, what d'I see?

37
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:29,638
Nothing, sir, nothing, and noon at hand, The doubloon goes a-begging, see the sun, Ay, ay, it must be so, I've over-sailed him,

38
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:30,900
How, got the start.

39
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:32,863
Aye, he's chasing M.E.

40
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:34,345
now, not I, him that's.

41
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:37,270
Tracking them, stow, mean I him.

42
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:39,734
That's bad, I might have known it too.

43
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:43,640
Fool, the lines, the harpoons he's towing.

44
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:46,444
Aye, aye, I have run him by last night.

45
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:49,249
About, about, come down all of ye.

46
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,774
But the regular lookouts, man the braces.

47
00:03:53,176 --> 00:04:04,232
Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she re-churned the cream in her own white wake.

48
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:12,625
Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw, murmured Starbuck to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main brace upon the rail.

49
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:18,814
God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh.

50
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,980
I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him.

51
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,264
"'Stand by to sway me up,' cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.

52
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:28,666
"'We should meet him soon.'

53
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:35,513
"'Aye, aye, sir,' and straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and once more Ahab swung on high.

54
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:39,537
A whole hour now passed, gold beaten out to ages.

55
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:43,501
Time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense.

56
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:52,090
But at last, some three points off the weather-bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three mastheads,

57
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:55,529
Three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.

58
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:59,427
Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick.

59
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,557
On deck there.

60
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:04,138
brace sharper up, crowd her into the wind's eye.

61
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,142
He's too far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck.

62
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:08,643
The sails shake.

63
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:11,387
Stand over that helmsman with a top maul.

64
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:12,868
So, so.

65
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,331
He travels fast, and I must down.

66
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:19,016
But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea.

67
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:20,097
There's time for that.

68
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:30,109
An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young, I, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy from the sandhills of Nantucket.

69
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:33,954
The same, the same, the same to Noah as to me.

70
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:36,318
There's a soft shower to leeward.

71
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,220
Such lovely leewardings.

72
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:44,068
They must lead somewhere, to something else than common land, more palmy than the palms.

73
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:45,170
Leeward!

74
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:47,173
The white whale goes that way.

75
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:48,635
Look to windward, then.

76
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,557
The better if the bitterer quarter.

77
00:05:51,078 --> 00:05:53,241
But good-bye, good-bye, old masthead.

78
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:54,242
What's this?

79
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:55,023
Green?

80
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:58,408
Aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks.

81
00:05:58,388 --> 00:06:01,392
No such green weather stains on Ahab's head.

82
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:05,658
There's the difference now between man's old age and matters.

83
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,463
But I, old mast, we both grow old together.

84
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:12,247
Sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship?

85
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,910
I, minus a leg, that's all.

86
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:19,276
By heaven, this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way.

87
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:21,058
I can't compare with it.

88
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:28,328
And I've known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers.

89
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,001
What's that?"

90
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:29,401
he said.

91
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:33,767
He should still go before me, my pilot, and yet to be seen again.

92
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:34,948
But where?

93
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:40,054
Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs?

94
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:43,839
And all night I've been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to?

95
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,147
Ay, ay, like many more thou told'st direful truth is touching thyself, O Parsi.

96
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:53,012
But, Ahab, there thy shot fell short.

97
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:54,715
Good-bye, masthead.

98
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:58,000
Keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone.

99
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:04,671
We'll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail."

100
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:11,262
He gave the word, and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck.

101
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:14,127
In due time the boats were lowered,

102
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:19,013
But as standing in his shallop stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent.

103
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:24,120
He waved to the mate, who held one of the tackle ropes on deck, and bade him pause.

104
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:25,521
Starbuck.

105
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:26,543
Sir.

106
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:31,889
For the third time my sole ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.

107
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,732
Ay, sir, thou wilt have it so.

108
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:39,479
Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing, Starbuck.

109
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:41,802
Truth, sir, saddest truth.

110
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:50,076
Some men die at ebb tide, some at low water, some at the full of the flood, and I feel now like a billow that's all one crested comb, Starbuck.

111
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:52,800
I am old, shake hands with me, man.

112
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:57,087
Their hands met, their eyes fastened, Starbuck's tears the glue.

113
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:01,815
Oh, my captain, my captain, my captain, noble heart.

114
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,018
Go not, go not, go not.

115
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,202
See, it's a brave man that weeps.

116
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:08,365
How great the agony of the persuasion then.

117
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:12,131
Lower away, cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm from him.

118
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:13,573
Stand by the crew.

119
00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:17,239
In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,766
The sharks, the sharks, cried a voice from the low cabin window there.

121
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,630
Oh master, my master, come back.

122
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:29,926
But Ahab heard nothing, for his own voice was high-lifted then, and the boat leaped on.

123
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:42,029
Yet the voice spake true, for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars.

124
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,120
Every time they dipped in the water, and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites.

125
00:08:48,708 --> 00:09:01,019
It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale boats in those swarming seas, the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east.

126
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,145
But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the white whale had been first described.

127
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:18,715
And whether it was that Ahab's crew were all such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks, a matter sometimes well known to affect them,

128
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:23,541
However it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.

129
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:26,376
Heart of wrought steel!

130
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:31,352
murmured Starbuck, gazing over the side, and following with his eyes the receding boat.

131
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:42,407
Canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight, lowering Nykeel among ravening sharks, and followed by them, open mouth to the chase, and this the critical third day?

132
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:52,562
For when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit, be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the evening, and the end of that thing?

133
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:54,945
Be that end what it may.

134
00:09:54,925 --> 00:10:03,598
Oh, my God, what is this that shoots through me and leaves me so deadly calm yet expectant, fixed at the top of a shutter?

135
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,010
Future things swim before me as in empty outlines and skeletons, all the past is somehow grown dim.

136
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:19,394
Mary, girl, thou fadest in pale glories behind me, boy, I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue.

137
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:24,082
Strangest problems of life seem clearing, but clouds sweep between.

138
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:26,286
Is my journey's end coming?

139
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:31,075
My legs feel faint, like his who has footed it all day.

140
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,018
Feel thy heart, beats it yet?

141
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,046
Stir thyself, starbuck, stave it off, move, move, speak aloud.

142
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:41,691
Mast head there, see ye my boy's hand on the hill.

143
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:47,620
Crazed, aloft there, keep thy keenest eye upon the boats, mark well the whale.

144
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,326
Ho, again, drive off that hawk, see.

145
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:57,535
He pecks, he tears the vein, pointing to the red flag flying at the main truck.

146
00:10:57,903 --> 00:10:59,865
Ah, he soars away with it.

147
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,568
Where's the old man now?

148
00:11:02,168 --> 00:11:04,191
Seest thou that sight, O Ahab?

149
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:05,452
Shudder, shudder!

150
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:13,502
The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads, a downward-pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded.

151
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:26,138
But intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel, the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow.

152
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:30,673
Drive, drive in your nails, O ye waves, To their uttermost heads drive them in.

153
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:37,355
Ye but strike a thing without a lid, And no coffin and no hearse can be mine, And hemp only can kill me.

154
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:38,378
Ha!

155
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:38,980
Ha!

156
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:50,289
Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles, then quickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising to the surface.

157
00:11:51,090 --> 00:12:05,305
A low rumbling sound was heard, a subterraneous hum, and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with trailing ropes and harpoons and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea.

158
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:13,158
Shrouded in a thin, drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air, and then fell swamping back into the deep.

159
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:26,601
Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.

160
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:27,742
Give way!"

161
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:32,250
cried Ahab to the oarsman, and the boats darted forward to the attack.

162
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:40,605
But maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven.

163
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:49,180
The wide tears of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together.

164
00:12:49,160 --> 00:13:04,401
As head on, he came churning his tail among the boats, and once more flailed them apart, spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.

165
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:12,759
while Dagoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks, and as the whale swimming out from them, turned and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again.

166
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:25,005
At that moment a quick cry went up, lashed round and round to the fish's back, pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him.

167
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:27,690
The half-torn body of the Parsee was seen.

168
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:33,180
His sable raiment frayed to shreds, his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.

169
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,584
The harpoon dropped from his hand.

170
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:36,886
Be fooled!

171
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:37,828
Be fooled!

172
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,336
Drawing in a long, lean breath, I, Parsee,

173
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:43,398
I see thee again.

174
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:47,805
I and thou goest before, and this, T.H.I.

175
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:50,149
this then is the hearse that thou didst promise.

176
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,234
But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word.

177
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:55,217
Where is the second hearse?

178
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:56,900
Away, mates, to the ship.

179
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:58,903
Those boats are useless now.

180
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:04,372
Repair them if he can in time, and return to me, if not, Ahab is enough to die.

181
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:05,995
Down, men.

182
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:11,159
The first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon.

183
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,546
Ye are not other men but my arms and my legs, and so obey me.

184
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:16,788
Where's the whale?

185
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:17,870
Gone down again?

186
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:28,928
But he looked too nigh the boat, for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage,

187
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:40,108
Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward and had almost passed the ship, which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.

188
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:47,001
He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.

189
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:53,849
Oh, Ahab, cried Starbuck, not too late is it, even now, the third day, to desist.

190
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:57,058
See, Moby-Dick seeks thee not.

191
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,568
It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him.

192
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:23,265
Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward by both oars and canvas, and at last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's face as he leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval.

193
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:36,965
Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Kwekweg, and Dagu eagerly mounting to the three mastheads, while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them.

194
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:48,122
One after the other, through the portholes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stuv and Flask busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances.

195
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:55,643
As he saw all this, as he heard the hammers and the broken boats, far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.

196
00:15:56,164 --> 00:16:10,650
But he rallied, and now marking that the vein or flag was gone from the main mast head, he shouted to Tashtego who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.

197
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:28,048
Whether fagged by the three days' running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore, or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him, whichever was true, the white whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more.

198
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:32,372
though indeed the whale's last start had not been so long a one as before.

199
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:49,099
And still, as Ahab glided over the waves, the unpitying sharks accompanied him, and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat, and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea at almost every dip.

200
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:54,407
Heed them not, those teeth, but give new rollocks to your oars.

201
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:55,175
Pull on!

202
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:58,639
Tis the better rest the shark's jaw than the yielding water.

203
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,365
But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller.

204
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,028
They will last long enough.

205
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:05,849
Pull on!

206
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:11,476
But who can tell, he muttered, whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab.

207
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:12,357
But pull on!

208
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:13,959
Aye, all alive now.

209
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,821
We near him.

210
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:16,543
The helm, take the helm.

211
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:17,544
Let me pass.

212
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:22,791
And so saying, two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still-flying boat.

213
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:34,755
At length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along with the white whale's flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance, as the whale sometimes will.

214
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:43,539
and Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled round his great manadnock hump.

215
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:56,980
He was even thus close to him, when, with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high lifted to the poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale.

216
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:17,879
As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed, spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea.

217
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:26,967
As it was, three of the oarsmen, who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects,

218
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:38,931
These were flung out, but so fell that, in an instant, two of them clutched the gunwale again and, rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again.

219
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:43,387
the third man helplessly dropping a stern but still afloat and swimming.

220
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:52,644
Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness, the white whale darted through the weltering sea.

221
00:18:53,546 --> 00:19:02,843
But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and hold it so, and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark,

222
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:08,509
The moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air.

223
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,091
What breaks in me?

224
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:15,358
Some sinew cracks, tis whole again, oars, oars, burst in upon him.

225
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:22,328
Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay.

226
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:30,619
But in that evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship, seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions,

227
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:41,757
Bethinking it, it may be, a larger and nobler foe, of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

228
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:45,323
Ahab staggered, his hand smote his forehead.

229
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:49,991
I grow blind, hands, stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way.

230
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,093
Is it night?

231
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,998
The whale, the ship, cried the cringing oarsman.

232
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,881
Oars, oars!

233
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:03,752
Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark.

234
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:05,955
I see, the ship, the ship!

235
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,417
Dash on, my men!

236
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:09,119
Will ye not save my ship?

237
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:19,253
But as the oarsmen violently force their boat through the sledgehammering seas, the before-whalesmitten bow-ends of two planks burst through, and in an instant almost,

238
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:28,433
The temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves, its half-weighting, splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bail out the pouring water.

239
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:50,438
Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammer remained suspended in his hand, and the red flag, half-wrapping him as with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him as his own forward-flowing heart, while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon as he.

240
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,134
The whale, the whale, uphelm, uphelm!

241
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:57,959
O all ye sweet powers of air, now hug me close.

242
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,206
Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman's fainting fit.

243
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:04,948
Uphelm, I say!

244
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:07,652
Ye fools, the jaw, the jaw!

245
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:12,759
Is this the end of all my bursting prayers, all my lifelong fidelities?

246
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,864
O Ahab, Ahab, lo thy work!

247
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:21,372
Steady, Helmsman, steady, nay, nay, up Helm again.

248
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:23,055
He turns to meet us.

249
00:21:23,856 --> 00:21:29,286
Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart.

250
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:31,490
My God, stand by me now.

251
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:39,223
Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help Stub, for Stub, too, sticks here.

252
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:46,868
I grin at thee, thou grinning whale, Whoever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, But Stubb's own unwinking eye.

253
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:51,029
And now poor Stug goes to bed upon a mattress that is all too soft.

254
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,092
Would it were stuffed with brushwood.

255
00:21:53,853 --> 00:21:55,695
I grin at thee, thou grinning whale.

256
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,858
Look ye, sun, moon, and stars.

257
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:02,043
I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost.

258
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:06,108
For all that I would yet wring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup.

259
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:12,096
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, thou grinning whale, but there'll be plenty of gulping soon.

260
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:13,819
Why fly ye not, O Ahab?

261
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,107
For me, off shoes and jacket to it, Let stub die in his drawers.

262
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,591
A most mouldy and over-salted death, though.

263
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:21,372
Cherries!

264
00:22:21,593 --> 00:22:21,773
Cherries!

265
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:22,013
Cherries!

266
00:22:22,034 --> 00:22:22,214

Cherries!

284
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:26,521
Cherries!

285
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:26,722
Cherries!

286
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:27,022
Cherries!

287
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:27,223
Cherries!

288
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:27,423
Cherries!

289
00:22:27,443 --> 00:22:27,623
Cherries!

290
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:27,824
Cherries!

291
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:28,024
Cherries!

292

Cherries!

Cherries!

295
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:28,825
Cherries!

296
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:29,026
Cherries!

297
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:29,286
Cherries!

298
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:29,527
Cherries!

299
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:29,807
Cherries!

300

Cherries!

311
00:22:32,372 --> 00:22:32,552
Cherries!

312
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:32,772
Cherries!

313
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:32,973
Cherries!

314
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:33,193
Cherries!

315
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:33,414
Cherries!

316
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:33,634
Cherries!

317
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:33,854
Cherries!

318
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:34,075
Cherries!

319
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:34,315
Cherries!

320
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:34,636
Cherries!

321
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:34,836
Cherries!

322
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:35,036
Cherries!

323
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:35,237
Cherries!

324
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:35,417
Cherries

325
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:36,260
Oh, stub!

326
00:22:36,762 --> 00:22:39,633
I hope my poor mother's drawn my part pay ere this.

327
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:44,631
If not, few coppers will now come to her, for the voyage is up.

328
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:48,474
From the ship's bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive.

329
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:57,227
Hammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their hands, just as they had darted from their various employments.

330
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:09,724
All their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed.

331
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:22,746
Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's starboard bow till men and timbers reeled.

332
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,150
Some fell flat upon their faces.

333
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:30,919
Like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooners aloft shook on their bull-like necks.

334
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:35,597
Through the breach they heard the waters pour as mountain torrents down a flume.

335
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:36,939
The ship!

336
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,060
The hearse!

337
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:39,562
The second hearse!

338
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:41,504
cried Ahab from the boat.

339
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,366
Its wood could only be American.

340
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:57,160
Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel, but turning underwater, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab's boat, where, for a time, he lay quiescent.

341
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:59,623
I turned my body from the sun.

342
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:02,167
What ho, Tashtego, let me hear thy hammer!

343
00:24:02,948 --> 00:24:17,088
O ye three unsurrendered spires of mine, Thou uncracked keel, and only God-bullied hull, Thou firm deck, and haughty helm, And pole-pointed prow, death-glorious ship, Must ye then perish, and without me?

344
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:21,895
Am I cut off from the last fond pride Of meanest shipwrecked captains?

345
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,419
O lonely death on lonely life!

346
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,526
O now I feel my topmost greatness Lies in my topmost grief!

347
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:29,907
Ho!

348
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:30,347
ho!

349
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:40,202
from all your furthest bounds, Pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life, And top this one-piled comber of my death.

350
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:57,167
Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale, To the last I grapple with thee, from hell's heart I stab at thee, For hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee, Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool.

351
00:24:57,147 --> 00:25:04,436
And since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale.

352
00:25:05,077 --> 00:25:06,519
Thus I give up the spear.

353
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:14,288
The harpoon was darted, the stricken whale flew forward, with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves, ran foul.

354
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:26,884
Ahab stooped to clear it, he did clear it, but the flying turn caught him round the neck, and voicelessly, as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.

355
00:25:26,864 --> 00:25:36,078
Next instant, the heavy ice splice in the rope's final end flew out of the stark empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and, smiting the sea, disappeared in its depths.

356
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:40,485
For an instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still, then turned.

357
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:41,607
The ship?

358
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,451
Great God, where is the ship?

359
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,909
Soon they, through dim, bewildering mediums, saw her sidelong, fading phantom as in the gaseous Fata Morgana.

360
00:25:52,590 --> 00:26:04,785
Only the uppermost masts out of water, while fixed by infatuation or fidelity or fate to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooners still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.

361
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:21,863
And now, concentric circle seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.

362
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:30,814
but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible.

363
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:50,837
Together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost touched, at that instant a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar.

364
00:26:50,817 --> 00:27:00,154
a skyhawk that tauntingly had followed the main truck downwards from its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and in commoting Tashtego there.

365
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:14,800
This bird now chanced to intercept its broad, fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood, and simultaneously feeling that ethereal thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death gasp, kept his hammer frozen there.

366
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:30,621
And so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her.

367
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:43,639
Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf, a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides, then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.

368
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:44,260
Ebalog.

369
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,103
And I only am escaped alone to tell thee, Job.

370
00:27:48,704 --> 00:27:49,585
The drama's done.

371
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:52,227
Why then here does any one step forth?

372
00:27:52,787 --> 00:27:54,489
Because one did survive the wreck.

373
00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:04,659
It's so chanced, that after the Parsees' disappearance, I was he whom the fates ordained to take the place of Ahab's bozeman, when that bozeman assumed the vacant post.

374
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:11,685
The same, who, when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern.

375
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:24,253
So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the half-spent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex.

376
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:28,543
When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool.

377
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:37,715
Round and round then and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve.

378
00:28:38,236 --> 00:28:55,678
Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over and floated by my side.

379
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,116
Buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirge-like main.

380
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:06,749
The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths.

381
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,459
The savage sea hawks sailed with sheathed beaks.

382
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:14,490
On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last.

383
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:21,970
It was the devious cruising Rachel that in her retracing search after her missing children only found another orphan.
