CHAPTER XXIV - THE ADVOCATE.

00:00:01,973 --> 00:00:02,654
CHAPTER XXIV - THE ADVOCATE.

3
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:22,579
As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling, and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit, therefore I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.

4
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:34,333
In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions.

5
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:46,828
If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were he presented to the company as a harpooner, say,

6
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:58,722
And if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials SWF Sperm Whale Fishery to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed preeminently presuming and ridiculous.

7
00:00:59,383 --> 00:01:16,444
Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen is this, they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business, and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements.

8
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:18,677
butchers we are, that is true.

9
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:27,189
But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all marshal commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor.

10
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:45,216
And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts, hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm-whale ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth.

11
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:59,458
But even granting the charge in question to be true, what disordered, slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battlefields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies' ploddits?

12
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:16,692
And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier's profession, let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head.

13
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:23,202
For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God?

14
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:32,975
But, though the world scouts at us whale-hunters, yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage, onage, yea, an all-abounding adoration.

15
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:42,388
For almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory.

16
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:48,893
But look at this matter in other lights, weigh it in all sorts of scales, see what we whalemen are and have been.

17
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:54,032
Why did the Dutch in De Witt's time have admirals of their whaling fleets?

18
00:02:54,215 --> 00:03:05,606
Why did Louis XVI of France, at his own personal expense, fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket?

19
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:15,736
Why did Britain, between the years 1750 and 1788, pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of El Whelmin in bounties upwards of El One Milne?

20
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:23,243
And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world?

21
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:29,980
sail a navy of upwards of 700 vessels, manned by 18,000 men, yearly consuming $4,000,000.

22
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:40,506
The ship's worth, at the time of sailing, $20 billion, and every year importing into our harbors a well-reaped harvest of $7 billion.

23
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,634
How comes all this, if there be not something puissant in wailing?

24
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:47,057
But this is not the half, look again.

25
00:03:47,077 --> 00:04:04,840
I freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life, point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of wailing.

26
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:18,590
One way and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that wailing may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb.

27
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,137
It would be a hopeless, endless task to catalog all these things.

28
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,680
Let a handful suffice.

29
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:32,146
For many years past, the whale ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth.

30
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:38,935
She has explored seas and archipelagos which had no chart, where no cook or Vancouver had ever sailed.

31
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:52,832
If American and European men of war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale ship, which originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savages.

32
00:04:52,812 --> 00:05:06,367
They may celebrate as they will the heroes of explorin' expeditions, your cooks, your cruis'nsterns, but I say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of Nantucket that were as great and greater than your cook and your cruis'nstern.

33
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:20,423
For in their suckerless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared.

34
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:29,640
All that has made such a flourish of, in the old South Sea voyages, those things were but the lifetime commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers.

35
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:39,002
Often, adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship's common log.

36
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,323
Ah, the world!

37
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:41,405
Oh, the world!

38
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:55,354
Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial, scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast.

39
00:05:55,334 --> 00:06:17,427
It was the whalemen who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies, and, if space permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chile, and Bolivia from the yoke of old Spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.

40
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:23,856
That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given to the enlightened world by the whalemen.

41
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:33,687
After its first blunder-borne discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous, but the whale ship touched there.

42
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:38,013
The whale ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.

43
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:49,708
Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale ship, luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.

44
00:06:50,178 --> 00:07:03,472
the uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whale ship that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations.

45
00:07:04,513 --> 00:07:15,004
If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale ship alone to whom the credit will be due, for already she is on the threshold.

46
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:27,684
But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every time?

47
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:33,533
The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will say.

48
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:37,502
the whale-no-famous author, and holing-no-famous chronicler?

49
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,406
Who wrote the first account of our leviathan?

50
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:41,948
Who but mighty Job?

51
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:46,453
And who composed the first narrative of a whaling voyage?

52
00:07:46,794 --> 00:07:57,748
Who, but no less a prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from other the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times?

53
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,692
And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament?

54
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:02,755
Who but Edmund Burke?

55
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,841
True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils.

56
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:09,264
They have no good blood in their veins.

57
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:11,988
No good blood in their veins.

58
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:15,653
They have something better than royal blood there.

59
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:33,102
The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrell, afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and Harponeers, all kith and kin to noble Benjamin, this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.

60
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,914
Good again, but then I'll confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.

61
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:39,916
Whaling not respectable?

62
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:41,918
Whaling is imperial.

63
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,984
By Old English statutory law, the whale is declared a royal fish.

64
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:49,346
Oh, that's only nominal.

65
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:53,590
The whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way.

66
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,195
The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?

67
00:08:58,175 --> 00:09:11,773
In one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world's capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymbaled procession, Tumtama.

68
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:15,378
See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.

69
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:21,786
Grant it, since you cite it, but, say what you will, there is no real dignity in whaling.

70
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:22,971
No.

71
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:24,774
Dignity in Walling?

72
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,282
The dignity of our calling, the very heavens attest.

73
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:32,087
Cetus is a constellation in the south.

74
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:33,349
No more.

75
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,837
Drive down your hat in presence of the Tsar and take it off to Queequeg.

76
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:38,818
No more.

77
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,989
I know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty whales.

78
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:51,701
I account that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.

79
00:09:52,522 --> 00:10:06,420
And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me, if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high-hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of,

80
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:19,655
If hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather have done than to have left undone, if, at my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious M.S.S.

81
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:29,995
in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling, for a whaleship was my Yale college and my Harvard.
