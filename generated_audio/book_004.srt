1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,197
book forth the visit to King Menelaus, who tells his story.

2
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:06,984
Meanwhile, the Suttors and Ithaca plot against Telemachus.

3
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:23,153
They reach the low-lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove straight to the abode of Menelaus 36 and found him in his own house, feasting with his many clansmen in honor of the wedding of his son, and also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior, Achilles.

4
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:35,142
He had given his consent and promised her to him while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the marriage about, so he was sending her with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons, over whom Achilles' son was reigning.

5
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:40,956
For his only son, he had found a bride from Sparta thou the thousand thirty-seven, the daughter of Elector.

6
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:51,439
This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven vouchsafed Helen no more children after she had born Hermione, who was fair as golden Venus herself.

7
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:56,208
So the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making merry in his house.

8
00:00:56,669 --> 00:01:04,463
There was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up with his tune.

9
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:05,445
38.

10
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:15,540
Telemachus and the son of Nesta stayed their horses at the gate, whereon Etionia's servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw them ran hurrying back into the house to tell his master.

11
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:22,671
He went close up to him and said, Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two men, who look like sons of Jove.

12
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,692
What are we to do?

13
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:27,876
Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?"

14
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:35,444
Menelaus was very angry and said, "'Eteonius, son of Boathouse, you never used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton.

15
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:39,609
Take their horses out, of course, and show the strangers, in that they may have supper.

16
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:47,697
You and I have stayed often enough at other people's houses before we go back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace henceforward.'"

17
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:51,021
So Itionius bustled back and bade the other servants come with him.

18
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:57,468
They took their sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to the mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed.

19
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,453
Then they leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into the house.

20
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:08,700
Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished when they saw it, for its splendor was as that of the sun and moon.

21
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:15,608
Then, when they had admired everything to their heart's content, they went into the bathroom and washed themselves.

22
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:23,641
When the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they brought them woolen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seats by the side of Menelaus.

23
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:32,815
A maid servant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them.

24
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:43,131
An upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.

25
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:51,481
Menelaus then greeted them, saying, Full too, and welcome, when you have done supper, I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of such men as you cannot have been lost.

26
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:57,488
You must be descended from a line of sceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as you are.

27
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:07,060
On this he handed them thirty-nine a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.

28
00:03:07,597 --> 00:03:21,429
As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his head so close that no one might hear, Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see the gleam of bronze and gold, of amber forty ivory and silver.

29
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,833
Everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian Jove.

30
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,675
I am lost in admiration.

31
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:37,283
Menelaus overheard him and said, No one, my sons, can hold his own with Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal, but among mortal men.

32
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:40,947
Well, there may be another who has as much wealth as I have, or there may not.

33
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:47,816
But at all events I have travelled much, and have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I could get home with my fleet.

34
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,659
I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the Egyptians.

35
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:59,710
I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians and the Arambians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, and the sheep lamb down three times a year.

36
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:07,136
Everyone in that country, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat and good milk, for the ewes yield all the year round.

37
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:18,192
But while I was travelling and getting great riches among these people, my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, so that I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth.

38
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:27,925
Whoever your parents may be, they must have told you about all this, and of my heavy loss in the ruin for one of a stately mansion fully and magnificently furnished.

39
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:36,253
would that I had only a third of what I now have so that I had stayed at home and all those were living who perished on the plain of Troy, far from Argos.

40
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:40,969
I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and all of them,

41
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:48,375
At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I leave off again, for crying is cold comfort, and one soon tires of it.

42
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:53,180
Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so for one man, more than for them all.

43
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,444
I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me.

44
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:02,948
For no one of all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did.

45
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:11,496
He took nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive or dead.

46
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:20,487
His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account.

47
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:25,774
Thus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he bethought him of his father.

48
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:32,222
Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face with both hands.

49
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:40,572
When Menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at once and find what it was all about.

50
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:47,727
While he was thus in two minds, Helen came down from her high-vaulted and perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself.

51
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:56,164
Adraste brought her a seat, Alcipe a soft woolen rug, while Philo fetched her the silver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her.

52
00:05:56,144 --> 00:06:00,512
Polybus lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world.

53
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:06,603
He gave Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and ten talents of gold.

54
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:16,802
Besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff and a silver workbox that ran on wheels with a gold band round the top of it.

55
00:06:16,782 --> 00:06:24,574
Philo now placed this by her side, full of fine-spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet-colored wool was laid upon the top of it.

56
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:30,383
Then Helen took her seat, put her feet upon the footstool, and began to question her husband Forty-two.

57
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:35,611
"'Do we know, Menelaus,' said she, "'the names of these strangers who have come to visit us?

58
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:37,754
Shall I guess right or wrong?

59
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:40,478
But I cannot help saying what I think.

60
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,305
Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like somebody else.

61
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:57,049
Indeed, when I look at him I hardly know what to think, as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in your hearts, on account of my most shameless self.

62
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:00,835
My dear wife, replied Menelaus, I see the likeness just as you do.

63
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:06,866
His hands and feet are just like Ulysses, so is his hair, with the shape of his head and the expression of his eyes.

64
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:15,240
Moreover, when I was talking about Ulysses and saying how much he had suffered on my account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.

65
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:28,541
Then Pisistratus said, Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in thinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest and is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose conversation is so divinely interesting as your own.

66
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:35,912
My father, Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether you could give him any counsel or suggestion.

67
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:46,881
A son has always trouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters, and this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent and there is no one among his own people to stand by him.

68
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,706
Bless my heart, replied Menelaus.

69
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:55,135
Then I am receiving a visit from the son of a very dear friend who suffered much hardship for my sake.

70
00:07:55,656 --> 00:08:02,187
I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas.

71
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:06,062
should have founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house.

72
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:14,156
I should have made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and should have sacked for them some one of the neighboring cities that are subject to me.

73
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:20,708
We should thus have seen one another continually, and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an intercourse.

74
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,715
I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great good fortune,

75
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:27,458
for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at all.

76
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,983
Thus did he speak, and his words set them all a-weeping.

77
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:34,607
Helen wept, Telemachus wept, and so did Menelaus.

78
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:41,816
Nor could Peisistratus keep his eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus, whom the son of Bright Dawn had killed.

79
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:51,327
Thereon he said to Menelaus, Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, told me you were a person of rare and excellent understanding.

80
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:54,291
If, then, it be possible, do as I would urge you.

81
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:57,216
I am not fond of crying while I am getting my supper.

82
00:08:57,716 --> 00:09:03,165
Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone.

83
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:05,488
This is all we can do for the poor things.

84
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:08,853
We can only shave our heads for them and wring the tears from our cheeks.

85
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:10,956
I had a brother who died at Troy.

86
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:14,361
He was by no means the worst man there, you are sure to have known him.

87
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,743
His name was Antilochus.

88
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:21,470
I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.

89
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:25,816
Your discretion, my friend, answered Menelaus, is beyond your years.

90
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,018
It is plain you take after your father.

91
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:34,306
One can soon see when a man is son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring.

92
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:44,179
And it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days, giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who are both well disposed and valiant.

93
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,943
We will put an end therefore to all this weeping and attend to our supper again.

94
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,165
Let water be poured over our hands.

95
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:53,568
Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in the morning.

96
00:09:54,329 --> 00:10:01,015
On this Asphalion, one of the servants poured water over their hands and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.

97
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:04,358
Then Jove's daughter Helen bethought her of another matter.

98
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:09,062
She drugged the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humor.

99
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:13,947
Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest of the day.

100
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:21,059
not even though his father and mother both of them drop down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes.

101
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:33,741
This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into the mixing bowl, and others poisonous.

102
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:39,951
Moreover, everyone in the whole country is a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeon,

103
00:10:39,931 --> 00:11:01,483
When Helen had put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants to serve the wine round, she said, Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honorable men, which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil, and can do what he chooses, feast here as you will, and listen while I tell you a tale in season.

104
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:11,559
I cannot indeed name every single one of the exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was before Troy and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties.

105
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:23,337
He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the enemy's city looking like a menial or a beggar and quite different from what he did when he was among his own people.

106
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:27,816
In this disguise he entered the city of Troy, and no one said anything to him.

107
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,837
I alone recognized him and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me.

108
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:46,655
When, however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans till he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships, he told me all that the Achaeans meant to do.

109
00:11:46,695 --> 00:11:54,848
He killed many Trojans and got much information before he reached the Argive camp, for all which things the Trojan women made lamentation.

110
00:11:55,809 --> 00:12:00,276
But for my own part I was glad, for my heart was beginning to yearn after my home.

111
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:12,161
And I was unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there, away from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by no means deficient either in person or understanding.

112
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:18,315
Then Menelaus said, All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is true.

113
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:25,066
I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes, but I have never seen such another man as Ulysses.

114
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:35,622
What endurance too, and what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the bravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans.43.

115
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:43,915
At that moment you came up to us, some god who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it, and you had Dyphobos with you.

116
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:47,182
Three times did you go all round our hiding place and pat it.

117
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:51,250
You called our chiefs each by his own name, and mimicked all our wives.

118
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:55,579
Diomedes, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside heard what a noise you made.

119
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,828
Diomedes and I could not make up our minds whether to spring out then and there,

120
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:12,255
or to answer you from inside, but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, all except Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clapped his two brawny hands over his mouth and kept them there.

121
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:17,867
It was this that saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away again."

122
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:24,675
How sad, exclaimed Telemachus, that all this was of no avail to save him, nor yet his own iron courage.

123
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:30,922
But now, sir, be pleased to send us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.

124
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:41,914
On this Helen told the maidservants to set beds in the room that was in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woolen cloaks for the guests to wear.

125
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:48,083
So the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to which a manservant presently conducted the strangers.

126
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:56,294
Thus then did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.

127
00:13:56,855 --> 00:14:01,962
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaus rose and dressed himself.

128
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:09,030
He bound his sandals onto his comely feet, girded his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an immortal god.

129
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:16,559
Then, taking a seat near Telemachus, he said, And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to Lacedaemon?

130
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,862
Are you on public or private business?

131
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,043
Tell me all about it.

132
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:25,890
I have come, sir, replied Telemachus, to see if you can tell me anything about my father.

133
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:36,809
I am being eaten out of house and home, my fair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen on the pretense of paying their addresses to my mother.

134
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:48,687
Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if happily you may tell me about my father's melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes or heard it from some other traveler, for he was a man born to trouble.

135
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:55,236
Do not soften things out of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw.

136
00:14:55,418 --> 00:15:06,552
If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loy service, either by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my favor and tell me truly all."

137
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,536
Menelaus, on hearing this, was very much shocked.

138
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:13,961
"'So,' he exclaimed, "'these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed.

139
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:17,646
A hind might as well lay her newborn young in the lair of a lion.

140
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:26,919
and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell, the lion when he comes back to his lair will make short work with the pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these suitors.

141
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:38,875
By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomelides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him,

142
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:44,766
If he is still such and were to come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.

143
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:55,024
As regards your questions, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment all that the old man of the sea told me.

144
00:15:55,595 --> 00:16:05,072
I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are very strict about having their Jews.

145
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:12,625
Now off Egypt, about as far as a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an island called Pharos.

146
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:23,197
It has a good harbor from which vessels can get out into open sea when they have taken in water, and here the gods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to help me forward.

147
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:36,958
We should have run clean out of provisions, and my men would have starved if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved me in the person of Idothia, daughter to Proteus, the old man of the sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me.

148
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:47,296
She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the men used to go with their barbed hooks all over the island in the hope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger.

149
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:49,041
Stranger, said she.

150
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,825
It seems to me that you like starving in this way.

151
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:59,152
At any rate, it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day after day, without even trying to get away, though your men are dying by inches.

152
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:07,960
Let me tell you, said I, whichever of the goddesses you may happen to be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have offended the gods that live in heaven.

153
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:18,150
Tell me, therefore, for the gods know everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in this way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my home.

154
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,295
Stranger, replied she, I will make it all quite clear to you.

155
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:25,501
There is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is Proteus.

156
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:29,106
He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father.

157
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:34,975
He is Neptune's headman and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom of the sea.

158
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:43,650
If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to take, and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home.

159
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:52,845
He will also tell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your house, both good and bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerous journey.

160
00:17:53,467 --> 00:18:00,600
Can you show me, said I, some stratagem by means of which I may catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out?

161
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:04,086
For a god is not easily caught, not by a mortal man.

162
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,532
Stranger, said she, I will make it all quite clear to you.

163
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:17,230
About the time when the sun shall have reached mid-heaven, the old man of the sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the west wind that furs the water over his head.

164
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:31,888
As soon as he has come up he lies down and goes to sleep in a great sea-cave, where the seals, Haile Sidney's chickens as they call them, come up also from the grey sea, and go to sleep in shoals all round him, and a very strong and fish-like smell do they bring with them.

165
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:32,929
44.

166
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,935
Early tomorrow morning I will take you to this place and will lay you in ambush.

167
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:44,585
Pick out, therefore, the three best men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the old man will play you.

168
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:47,930
First he will look over all his seals and count them.

169
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:54,379
Then, when he has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep among them as a shepherd among his sheep.

170
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,283
The moment you see that he is asleep, seize him.

171
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:02,671
Put forth all your strength and hold him fast, for he will do his very utmost to get away from you.

172
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:07,298
He will turn himself into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth.

173
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:09,603
and will become also both fire and water.

174
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:17,119
But you must hold him fast and grip him tighter and tighter till he begins to talk to you and comes back to what he was when you saw him go to sleep.

175
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:25,877
Then you may slacken your hold and let him go, and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry with you, and what you must do to reach your home over the seas.

176
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:34,432
Having so said, she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the place where my ships were ranged upon the shore, and my heart was clouded with care as I went along.

177
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:39,280
When I reached my ship we got supper ready, for night was falling and camped down upon the beach.

178
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:42,786
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,

179
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:50,032
I took the three men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went along by the seaside, praying heartily to heaven.

180
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:58,176
Meanwhile the goddess fetched me up four sealskins from the bottom of the sea, all of them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father.

181
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:02,122
Then she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should come up.

182
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:07,952
When we were close to her, she made us lie down in the pits one after the other, and threw a sealskin over each of us.

183
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:16,506
Our ambuscade would have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was most distressing forty-five who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could help it.

184
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:24,298
But here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of something that gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under each man's nostrils,

185
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:26,942
which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals.

186
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:28,485
46.

187
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:35,575
We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the seals come up in hundreds to bask upon the seashore.

188
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:44,329
Till at noon the old man of the seashore, till at noon the old man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he went over them and counted them.

189
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:50,867
We were among the first he counted, and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep as soon as he had done counting.

190
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:59,787
Then we rushed upon him with a shout and seized him, on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changed himself first into a lion with a great mane.

191
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:03,415
Then all of a sudden he became a dragon, a leopard,

192
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,336
a wild boar.

193
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:08,681
The next moment he was running water, and then again directly he was a tree.

194
00:21:09,261 --> 00:21:21,054
But we stuck to him and never lost hold, till at last the cunning old creature became distressed and said, Which of the gods was it, son of Atreus, that hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing me against my will?

195
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:22,196
What do you want?

196
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:24,538
You know that yourself, old man, I answered.

197
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:26,861
You will gain nothing by trying to put me off.

198
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:32,727
It is because I have been kept so long in this island, and see no sign of my being able to get away.

199
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,048
I am losing all heart.

200
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:42,898
Tell me then, for you gods know everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my home.

201
00:21:43,899 --> 00:22:02,460
Then, he said, if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly, you must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods before embarking, for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your friends and to your own house till you have returned to the heaven-fed stream of Egypt and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods that reign in heaven.

202
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,822
When you have done this, they will let you finish your voyage."

203
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:10,127
I was broken-hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long and terrible voyage to Egypt.

204
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,109
Forty-seven, nevertheless, I answered.

205
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:28,925
I will do all, old man, that you have laid upon me, but now tell me, and tell me true, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them came to a bad end, either on board his own ship or among his friends when the days of his fighting were done.

206
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:31,587
Son of Atreus, he answered, were done.

207
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:36,362
You had better not know what I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard my story.

208
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:45,610
Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many still remain, and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans perished during their return home.

209
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:49,404
As for what happened on the field of battle, you were there yourself.

210
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:54,094
A third Achaean leader is still at sea, alive, but hindered from returning.

211
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:58,524
Ajax was wrecked, for Neptune drove him onto the great rocks of Gyrai.

212
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:00,949
Nevertheless, he let him get safe out of the water.

213
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:06,501
And in spite of all Minerva's hatred, he would have escaped death if he had not ruined himself by boasting.

214
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:17,622
He said the gods could not drown him, even though they had tried to do so, and when Neptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident in his two brawny hands and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces.

215
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:26,358
The base remained where it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into the sea and carried Ajax with it, so he drank saltwater and was drowned.

216
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:30,345
Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him.

217
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:43,238
But when he was just about to reach the high promontory of Melea, he was caught by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against his will, and drove him to the foreland where theistes used to dwell, but where Aegisthus was then living.

218
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:47,472
By and by, however, it seemed as though he was to return safely after all.

219
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:57,005
For the gods backed the wind into its old quarter and they reached home, whereon Agamemnon kissed his native soil and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own country.

220
00:23:57,525 --> 00:24:03,433
Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch and to whom he had promised two talents of gold.

221
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:09,681
This man had been looking out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the slip and prepare war,

222
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:16,913
When, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go by, he went and told Agestas, who at once began to lay a plot for him.

223
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:26,168
He picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on one side, the cloister, while on the opposite side he prepared a banquet.

224
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:32,316
Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon and invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play.

225
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:41,268
He got him there, all unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when the banquet was over, as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles.

226
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:47,717
Not one of Agamemnon's followers was left alive, nor yet one of Aegisthus's, but they were all killed there in the cloisters.

227
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:52,543
Thus spoke Proteus, and I was brokenhearted as I heard him.

228
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:54,605
I sat down upon the sands and wept.

229
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:59,290
I felt as though I could no longer bear to live, nor look upon the light of the sun.

230
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:08,740
Presently, when I had had my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea said, Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in crying so bitterly.

231
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,462
It can do no manner of good.

232
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:20,353
Find your way home as fast as ever you can, for Aegisthus may be still alive, and even though Orestes has been beforehand with you in killing him, you may yet come in for his funeral.

233
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:24,783
On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, I know then about these two.

234
00:25:25,063 --> 00:25:26,687
Tell me therefore about these two.

235
00:25:26,747 --> 00:25:29,553
Tell me therefore about the third man of whom you spoke.

236
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:32,700
Is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to get home?

237
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:33,862
Or is he dead?

238
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:37,330
Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.

239
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:41,034
The third man, he answered, is Ulysses, who dwells in Ithaca.

240
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:51,687
I can see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home, for he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.

241
00:25:52,308 --> 00:26:00,297
As for your own end, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take you to the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world,

242
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:15,995
There fair-haired Radamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than anywhere else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail, nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a west wind that sings softly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men.

243
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:21,080
This will happen to you because you have married Helen, and are Jove's son-in-law."

244
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:28,849
As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back to the ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went along.

245
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:33,616
When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was falling and camped down upon the beach.

246
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:41,327
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn appeared, we drew our ships into the water and put our masts and sails within them.

247
00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:48,137
Then we went on board ourselves, took our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars.

248
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:54,508
I again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered hecatombs that were full and sufficient.

249
00:26:55,069 --> 00:27:05,168
When I had thus appeased heaven's anger, I raised a barrow to the memory of Agamemnon, that his name might live forever, after which I had a quick passage home, for the gods sent me a fair wind.

250
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:10,497
And now for yourself, stay here some ten or twelve days longer and I will then speed you on your way."

251
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:13,681
I will make you a noble present of a chariot and three horses.

252
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:20,571
I will also give you a beautiful chalice that so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a drink offering to the immortal gods.

253
00:27:21,512 --> 00:27:25,257
Son of Atreus, replied Telemachus, do not press me to stay longer.

254
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:28,342
I should be contented to remain with you for another twelve months.

255
00:27:28,802 --> 00:27:39,437
I find your conversation so delightful that I should never once wish myself at home with my parents, but my crew whom I have left at Pylos are already impatient and you are detaining me from them.

256
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:42,002
As for any present you may be disposed to make me,

257
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:44,500
I had rather that it should be a piece of plate.

258
00:27:45,100 --> 00:28:06,279
I will take no horses back with me to Ithaca, but will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you have much flat ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as also meadow sweet and wheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears, whereas in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor race courses, and the country is more fit for goats than horses, and I like it the better for that.

259
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,140
48.

260
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:12,445
None of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all.

261
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:15,849
Menelaus smiled and took Telemachus' hand within his own.

262
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,133
What you say, said he, shows that you come of good family.

263
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:25,741
I both can and will make this exchange for you by giving you the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house.

264
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:32,009
It is a mixing bowl by Vulcan's own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold.

265
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:38,837
Thadimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit which I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey.

266
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,422
I will make you a present of it."

267
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:43,994
Thus did they converse, and guests kept coming to the king's house.

268
00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:51,257
They brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for them to take with them, so they were busy cooking their dinners in the courts.

269
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:51,996
49.

270
00:28:53,018 --> 00:29:00,829
Meanwhile, the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark on the leveled ground in front of Ulysses' house and were behaving with all their old insolence.

271
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:14,848
Antinous and Eurymachus, who were their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were sitting together when Noman son of Phronius came up and said to Antinous, Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?

272
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:18,114
He has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Ellis.

273
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:26,609
I have twelve broodmares there with yearling mule foals by their side, not yet broken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and break him."

274
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:33,782
They were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that Telemachus had not gone to the city of Nellius.

275
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:38,675
They thought he was only away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep or with the swineherd.

276
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:40,998
So Antinous said, When did he go?

277
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:44,444
Tell me truly, and what young men did he take with him?

278
00:29:44,964 --> 00:29:46,948
Were they freemen or his own bondsmen?

279
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,750
For he might manage that too.

280
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:56,142
Tell me also, did you let him have the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he take it without your leave?

281
00:29:56,122 --> 00:29:58,267
I lent it him, answered Norman.

282
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:03,780
What else could I do when a man of his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige him?

283
00:30:04,381 --> 00:30:05,745
I could not possibly refuse.

284
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:14,485
As for those who went with him, they were the best young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on board as captain, or some god who was exactly like him.

285
00:30:14,465 --> 00:30:21,300
I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for Pylos."

286
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:25,570
Nomen then went back to his father's house, but Antinous and Eurymachus were very angry.

287
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:30,381
They told the others to leave off playing, and to come and sit down along with themselves.

288
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,427
When they came, Antinous son of Eupethes spoke in anger.

289
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:41,383
His heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said, Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter.

290
00:30:41,704 --> 00:30:48,117
We had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellow has got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too.

291
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,860
He will be giving us trouble presently.

292
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:52,325
May Jove take him before he is full grown.

293
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:58,718
Find me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos.

294
00:30:59,138 --> 00:31:03,467
He will then rue the day that he set out to try and get news of his father."

295
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,152
Thus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying.

296
00:31:06,192 --> 00:31:09,278
They then all of them went inside the buildings.

297
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:20,756
It was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were plotting, for a manservant, Medon, overheard them from outside the outer court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tell his mistress.

298
00:31:21,697 --> 00:31:27,807
As he crossed the threshold of her room, Penelope said, Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for?

299
00:31:27,787 --> 00:31:31,315
Is it to tell the maids to leave their master's business and cook dinner for them?

300
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:41,399
I wish they may neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of my son's estate.

301
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,829
Did not your fathers tell you when you were children how good Ulysses had been to them?

302
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:49,315
never doing anything high-handed, nor speaking harshly to anybody.

303
00:31:49,735 --> 00:32:03,598
Kings may say things sometimes, and they may take a fancy to one man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did an unjust thing by anybody, which shows what bad hearts you have, and that there is no such thing as gratitude left in this world.

304
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:09,387
Then Medan said, I wish, madam, that this were all, but they are plotting something much more dreadful now.

305
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:11,411
May heaven frustrate their design.

306
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:18,181
They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get news of his father.

307
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:26,635
Then Penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she was speechless, her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no utterance.

308
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:31,122
At last, however, she said, why did my son leave me?

309
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:36,810
What business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like seahorses?

310
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:41,156
Does he want to die without leaving anyone behind him to keep up his name?

311
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:51,970
I do not know, answered Medon, whether some god set him onto it, or whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if his father was dead or alive and on his way home.

312
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:57,558
Then he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief.

313
00:32:57,578 --> 00:32:59,320
There were plenty of seats in the house,

314
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,544
but she had no heart for sitting on any one of them.

315
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:18,912
She could only fling herself on the floor of her own room and cry, whereon all the maids in the house, both old and young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last, in a transport of sorrow, she exclaimed, My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction than any other woman of my age and country.

316
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:34,470
First I lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my having heard one word about his leaving home.

317
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,532
You hussies!

318
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:43,045
There was not one of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my bed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting.

319
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:52,240
If I had known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give it up, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse behind him, one or other.

320
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:59,073
Now, however, go some of you and call old Dolius, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is my gardener.

321
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:11,477
Bid him go at once, and tell everything to Laertes, who may be able to hit on some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side, as against those who are trying to exterminate his own race and that of Ulysses.

322
00:34:11,457 --> 00:34:19,546
Then the dear old nurse Eurycleia said, You may kill me, madam, or let me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the real truth.

323
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:34,883
I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he did not want you to spoil your beauty by crying.

324
00:34:34,863 --> 00:34:46,638
And now, madam, wash your face, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to Minerva, daughter of Aegis bearing Jove, for she can save him even though he be in the jaws of death.

325
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,323
Do not trouble Laertes, he has trouble enough already.

326
00:34:50,923 --> 00:35:02,558
Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the race of the son of Arkesias so much, but there will be a son left to come up after him, and inherit both the house and the fair fields that lie far all round it.

327
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:07,185
With these words she made her mistress leave off crying and dried the tears from her eyes.

328
00:35:08,346 --> 00:35:12,352
Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and went upstairs with her maids.

329
00:35:12,993 --> 00:35:17,058
She then put some bruised barley into a basket and began praying to Minerva.

330
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:21,745
Hear me, she cried, daughter of Aegis bearing Jove unweariable.

331
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:32,685
If ever Ulysses, while he was here, burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or heifer, bear it in mind now, as in my favor, and save my darling son from the villainy of the suitors."

332
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:36,912
She cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer.

333
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:45,808
Meanwhile, the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister, and one of them said, The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.

334
00:35:45,788 --> 00:35:49,094
Little does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die."

335
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:52,740
This was what they said, but they did not know what was going to happen.

336
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:58,590
Then Antinna said, Comrades, let there be no loud talking, lest some of it get carried inside.

337
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:03,358
Let us be up and do that in silence, about which we are all of a mind.

338
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:07,293
He then chose twenty men, and they went down to their ship and to the seaside.

339
00:36:07,674 --> 00:36:11,223
They drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and sails inside her.

340
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:20,706
They bound the oars to the thulpins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft, while their fine servants brought them their armour.

341
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:27,037
Then they made the ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and waited till night should fall.

342
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:35,387
But Penelope lay in her own room upstairs, unable to eat or drink, and wondering whether her brave son would escape or be overpowered by the wicked suitors.

343
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:46,542
Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen, hemming her in on every side she thought and thought, till she sank into a slumber and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.

344
00:36:46,522 --> 00:36:55,490
Then Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in the likeness of Penelope's sister Iphthime, daughter of Icarius, who had married Eumelus and lived in Ferai.

345
00:36:56,011 --> 00:37:08,082
She told the vision to go to the house of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so it came into her room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the door to, and hovered over her head, saying, You are asleep, Penelope.

346
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:11,625
The gods who live at ease will not suffer you to weep and be so sad.

347
00:37:12,325 --> 00:37:16,309
Your son has done them no wrong, so he will yet come back to you.

348
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:22,184
Penelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of Dreamland, answered, Sister, why have you come here?

349
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:26,756
You do not come very often, but I suppose that is because you live such a long way off.

350
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:31,969
Am I, then, to leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?

351
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:49,519
I, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship, a foolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it, nor to going about among gatherings of men.

352
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:52,584
I am even more anxious about him than about my husband.

353
00:37:53,025 --> 00:37:59,857
I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest something should happen to him, either from the people among whom he has gone or by sea.

354
00:38:00,558 --> 00:38:06,428
For he has many enemies who are plotting against him and are bent on killing him before he can return home.

355
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:10,092
Then the vision said, Take heart, and be not so much dismayed.

356
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:16,579
There is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand by his side, I mean Minerva.

357
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:21,164
It is she who has compassion upon you, and who has sent me to bear you this message.

358
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:29,113
Then said Penelope, If you are a god, or have been sent here by divine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one.

359
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:33,698
Is he still alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?

360
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:40,168
and the vision said, I shall not tell you for certain whether he is alive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation.

361
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:44,615
Then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door, and was dissipated into thin air.

362
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:49,702
But Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted, so vivid had been her dream.

363
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:56,192
Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea, intent on murdering Telemachus.

364
00:38:56,172 --> 00:39:05,492
Now there is a rocky islet called Asteris, of no great size, in mid-channel between Ithaca and Samos, and there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie.

365
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:09,000
Here then the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.
