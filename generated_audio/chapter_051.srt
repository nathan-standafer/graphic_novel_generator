Chapter 51 - The Spirit Spout

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:22,899
Chapter 51 - The Spirit Spout. Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising grounds, that off the Azores, off the Cape de Verdes, on the Plate so-called, being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, and the Carol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality southerly from St.

3
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:23,760
Helena.

4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:38,206
It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver, and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude.

5
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:44,618
On such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow.

6
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:50,627
Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial, seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea.

7
00:00:51,228 --> 00:01:01,082
Fadala first described this jet, for of these moonlight nights it was his want to mount to the main mast head and stand alook out there with the same precision as if it had been day.

8
00:01:01,843 --> 00:01:08,513
And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them.

9
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:10,656
You may think with what emotions then.

10
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:19,709
The seaman beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours, his turban in the moon, companions in one sky.

11
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,480
But when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound,

12
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:41,759
When, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moonlit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet, as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew.

13
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,662
There she blows!

14
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:51,392
Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more, yet still they felt no terror, rather pleasure.

15
00:01:51,642 --> 00:02:01,337
For though it was a most unwanted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering.

16
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:12,435
Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the tegallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread, the best man in the ship must take the helm.

17
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:17,680
Then, with every masthead manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind.

18
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:38,929
The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the tafrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet, while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her, one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal.

19
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:44,896
And had you watched Ahab's face that night, you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring.

20
00:02:45,377 --> 00:02:52,646
While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limbs sounded like a coffin tap.

21
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,050
On life and death this old man walked.

22
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:06,823
But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night.

23
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,734
Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.

24
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:17,304
This midnight spout had almost grown a forgotten thing when, some days after, lo!

25
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:22,972
at the same silent hour it was again announced, again it was described by all.

26
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:28,801
But upon making sail to overtake it, once more it disappeared as if it had never been.

27
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:34,549
And so it served us night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it.

28
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:50,175
mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be, disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three, and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van,

29
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:53,341
this solitary jet seemed forever alluring us on.

30
00:03:54,242 --> 00:04:12,214
Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with the preternaturalness as it seemed, which in many things invested the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever described, at however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes,

31
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:17,785
That unnearable spout was cast by oneself same whale, and that whale Moby Dick.

32
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:33,477
For a time there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas.

33
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:58,030
These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space and repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.

34
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:19,343
But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling around us and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are there, when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the foam flakes flew over her bulwarks.

35
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:25,200
Then all this desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.

36
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:34,547
Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us, while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens.

37
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:52,873
And every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen, and spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft, a thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves.

38
00:05:52,853 --> 00:06:05,277
and heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the Black Sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience, and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.

39
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:07,570
Cape of good hope, do they call ye?

40
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:10,756
Rather, Cape Tormentoto, as called of yore.

41
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:29,070
For long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon.

42
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:40,242
But calm, snow-white and unvarying, still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky, still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be described.

43
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:54,009
During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve, and more seldom than ever addressed his mates.

44
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:04,160
In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale.

45
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,984
Then captain and crew become practical fatalists.

46
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:24,657
So, with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together.

47
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:45,177
Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist, and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened belt.

48
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:57,293
Few or no words were spoken, and the silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves.

49
00:07:57,914 --> 00:08:02,160
By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed.

50
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:06,587
Still in silence the men swung in the bowlines, still wordless.

51
00:08:07,428 --> 00:08:08,970
Ahab stood up to the blast.

52
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:15,400
Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose, he would not seek that repose in his hammock.

53
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:18,379
Never could Starbuck forget the old man's aspect.

54
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:34,497
When one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair, the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat.

55
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:42,045
On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of.

56
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,829
His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand.

57
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:54,161
Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.

58
00:08:54,982 --> 00:09:04,354
The cabin compass is called the tell-tale because without going to the compass at the helm, the captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the ship.

59
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:12,302
Terrible old man, thought Starbuck with a shudder, Sleeping in this gale, still thou steadfastly Eyest thy purpose.
