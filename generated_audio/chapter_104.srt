00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,853
Chapter 104 - The Fossil Whale.

2
00:00:01,994 --> 00:00:02,915
Chapter 104 - The Fossil Whale.

3
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:11,248
From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate.

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,872
Would you, you could not compress him.

5
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:18,259
By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio.

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:35,944
Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the yards he measures about the waist, only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop deck of a line of battleship.

7
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:50,946
Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise, not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels.

8
00:00:51,247 --> 00:01:06,290
Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view, applied to any other creature than the Leviathan.

9
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:12,600
To an ant or a flea, such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent.

10
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:16,967
But when Leviathan is the text, the case is altered.

11
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:21,516
Fain am I to stagger to this imprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary.

12
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:42,702
And here be it said, that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarter edition of Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose, because that famous lexicographer's uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.

13
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:49,218
One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though it may seem but an ordinary one.

14
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,962
How, then, with me, writing of this leviathan?

15
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:57,246
Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals.

16
00:01:57,907 --> 00:02:02,051
Give me a condor's quill, give me Vesuvius's crater for an inkstand.

17
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:07,997
Friends, hold my arms, for in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this leviathan,

18
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:30,542
They weary me, and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs.

19
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:35,206
Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme.

20
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:37,168
We expand to its bulk.

21
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:40,932
To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.

22
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:46,837
No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.

23
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:57,407
Ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales, I present my credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stonemason.

24
00:02:57,387 --> 00:03:04,241
and also a great digger of ditches, canals, and wells, wine vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts.

25
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:16,206
Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct,

26
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:29,566
the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary Formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted, links between the anti-chronical creatures and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark.

27
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:42,885
All the fossil whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary Period, which is the last preceding the superficial formations, and though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time,

28
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:49,081
they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their taking rank as cetacean fossils.

29
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:57,904
Detached broken fossils of pre-Adamite whales, fragments of their bones and skeletons, have within 30 years passed at various intervals

30
00:03:58,323 --> 00:04:06,493
been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in Scotland, and in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

31
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:24,634
Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the Palace of the Tuileries, and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp in Napoleon's time.

32
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:30,820
Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic species.

33
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:43,990
But by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year 1842 on the plantation of Judge Cray in Alabama.

34
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:49,554
The awe-stricken, credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels.

35
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:56,798
The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus.

36
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,586
but some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English anatomist.

37
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:06,633
It turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species.

38
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:17,368
A significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body.

39
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:30,981
So Owen rechristened the monster Zuglodon, and in his paper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence.

40
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:43,153
When I stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea monsters,

41
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:50,708
but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable seniors.

42
00:05:51,710 --> 00:06:02,492
I am, by a flood, born back to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun, for time began with man, for time began with man.

43
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:22,422
Here, Saturn's grey chaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities, when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics, and in all the twenty-five thousand miles of this world's circumference, not an inhabitable hand's breadth of land was visible.

44
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:29,810
Then the whole world was the whales, and, king of creation, he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himalays.

45
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:33,002
Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan?

46
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:36,580
Ahab's harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh's.

47
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,104
Methuselah seems a schoolboy.

48
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:41,969
I look round to shake hands with Shem.

49
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:54,349
I am horror-struck at this antimosaic, unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.

50
00:06:54,329 --> 00:07:03,825
But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-Adamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust.

51
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:13,401
But upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable print of his fin.

52
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:29,027
In an apartment of the great temple of Dendera some 50 years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns.

53
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:36,560
Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore, was there swimming in that planisphere centuries before Solomon was cradled.

54
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:49,902
Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale, in his own Osseous post-Diluvian reality, as set down by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveler.

55
00:07:49,882 --> 00:08:00,562
Not far from the seaside, they have a temple, the rafters and beams of which are made of whale bones, for whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore.

56
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:08,818
The common people imagine that by a secret power bestowed by God upon the temple, no whale can pass it without immediate death.

57
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:16,869
But the truth of the matter is that on either side of the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea and wound the whales when they light upon them.

58
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:28,967
They keep a whale's rib of an incredible length for a miracle, which lying upon the ground with its convex part uppermost makes an arch, the head of which cannot be reached by a man upon a camel's back.

59
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:34,237
This rib, says John Leo, is said to have lain there a hundred years before I saw it.

60
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:46,222
There historians affirm that a prophet who prophesied of Muhammad came from this temple, and some do not stand to assert that the prophet Jonas was cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple.

61
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:53,959
In this African temple of the whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a Nantucketer and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.
