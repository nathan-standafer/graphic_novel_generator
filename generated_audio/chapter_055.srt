00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:04,928
Chapter 55 - Of the Monstrous Pictures of Wales.

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,474
I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas."

3
00:00:09,494 --> 00:00:20,227
Something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman, when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whaleship, so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.

4
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:31,320
It may be worthwhile, therefore, previously, to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him, which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,805
It is time to set the world right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong.

6
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:45,753
It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindu, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures.

7
00:00:46,394 --> 00:01:01,307
Forever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panelings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain armor like Saladines,

8
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:02,829
and a helmeted head like St.

9
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:12,560
George's ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific presentations of him.

10
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:23,532
Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale's is to be found in the famous cavern pagoda of Elephanta in India.

11
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:35,885
The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being.

12
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:41,931
No wonder, then, that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth.

13
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:52,962
The Hindu whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of Leviathan, learnedly known as the Matsya Avatar.

14
00:01:53,397 --> 00:02:01,048
But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.

15
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:07,598
It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes.

16
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:17,532
But go to the old galleries and look now at a great Christian painter's portrait of this fish, for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindu.

17
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:22,300
It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea monster or whale.

18
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:25,886
Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that?

19
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:32,316
Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own, Perseus descending, make out one whit better.

20
00:02:32,897 --> 00:02:39,368
The huge corbulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.

21
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:51,694
It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended, tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling might be taken for the trader's gate leading from the Thames by water into the tower.

22
00:02:52,556 --> 00:03:01,828
Then there are the prodromous whales of old Scotch-Sybild, and Jonah's whale, as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.

23
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:13,424
What shall be said of these, as for the bookbinder's whale winding like a vine stalk round the stalk of a descending anchor, as stamped and gilded on the backs and title pages of many books both old and new?

24
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:21,015
That is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.

25
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:30,607
Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this bookbinder's fish an attempt at a whale, because it was so intended when the device was first introduced.

26
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:45,163
It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the revival of learning, and in those days, and even down to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan.

27
00:03:45,143 --> 00:04:01,836
In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books, you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of spouts, jetstow, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.

28
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:07,782
In the title page of the original edition of The Advancement of Learning, you will find some curious whales.

29
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:18,559
But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those pictures of Leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations by those who know.

30
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:25,599
In Old Harris's collection of voyages, there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D.

31
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:34,333
1671, entitled, A Whaling Voyage to Spitsbergen and the Ship, Jonas and the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, Master.

32
00:04:35,054 --> 00:04:43,888
In one of those plates, the whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice aisles, with white bears running over their living backs.

33
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:49,446
In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.

34
00:04:50,167 --> 00:05:04,307
Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a post-captain in the English Navy, entitled, A Voyage Round Cape Horn Into the South Seas for the Purpose of Extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.

35
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:16,913
In this book is an outline purporting to be a picture of a physitor, or spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico August 1793 and hoisted on deck.

36
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,186
I doubt not the captain had this voracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines.

37
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:34,983
To mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full-grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long.

38
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:40,791
Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye?

39
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:50,123
Nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of mistake.

40
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:53,809
Look at that popular work, Goldsmith's Animated Nature.

41
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,316
In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged whale and a narwhal.

42
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:06,443
I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow.

43
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:18,456
And, as for the narwhal, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this 19th century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.

44
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:31,373
Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de La Cepede, a great naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.

45
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:45,912
All these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale, that is to say, the right whale, even Scoresby, a long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its counterpart in nature.

46
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:53,514
But the placing of the cap sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frédéric Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron.

47
00:06:54,136 --> 00:07:02,095
In 1836, he published A Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale.

48
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,288
Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket.

49
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:13,635
In a word, Frederick Cuvier's sperm whale is not a sperm whale, but a squash.

50
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:21,125
Of course, he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage, such men seldom have, but whence he derived that picture, who can tell?

51
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:31,018
Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions, that is, from a Chinese drawing.

52
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:37,802
And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.

53
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:44,242
As for the sign painter's whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil dealers, what shall be said of them?

54
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:46,486
They are generally Richard III.

55
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:58,566
Whales, with dromedary humps and very savage, breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whale boats full of mariners, their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.

56
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:04,195
But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all.

57
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:05,003
Consider.

58
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:21,745
Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish, and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.

59
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:29,028
Though elephants have stood for their full lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait.

60
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:37,928
The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters and afloat.

61
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:52,065
The vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched line of battleship, and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.

62
00:08:52,946 --> 00:09:06,362
And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young, sucking whale and a full-grown Plutonian leviathan, yet, even in the case of one of those young, sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck,

63
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:14,334
Such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.

64
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:22,145
But it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.

65
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:24,148
Not at all.

66
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:30,801
For it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.

67
00:09:31,382 --> 00:09:50,490
Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed, utilitarian old gentleman with all Jeremy's other leading personal characteristics, yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.

68
00:09:50,538 --> 00:10:02,111
In fact, as the great hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelops it.

69
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:08,958
This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown.

70
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:19,870
It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb.

71
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:25,641
This fin has four regular bone fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.

72
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:32,032
But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering.

73
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:40,508
However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us, said Humerus Stub one day, he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.

74
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:50,046
For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last.

75
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:58,902
True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness.

76
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:15,641
So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like, and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a-whaling yourself, but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.

77
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:22,189
Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.
