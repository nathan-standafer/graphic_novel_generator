00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:17,669
Chapter 54 THE TOWN HO'S STORY AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN THE FIRST The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is much like some noted four corners of a great highway where you meet more travellers than in any other park.

2
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:25,056
It was not very long after speaking the Ghani that another homeward-bound whaleman, the Town Ho, was encountered.

3
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:28,620
She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians.

4
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,267
In the short gam that ensued, she gave us strong news of Moby Dick.

5
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:53,680
To some, the general interest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town hoe's story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so-called judgments of God, which at times are said to overtake some men.

6
00:00:53,660 --> 00:01:13,120
This latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates, for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the town Hoe himself.

7
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:24,821
It was the private property of three Confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy.

8
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:35,901
But the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that, when he was wakened, he could not well withhold the rest.

9
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:57,197
Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod, who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among themselves, so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod's mainmast.

10
00:01:57,177 --> 00:02:04,311
interweaving, in its proper place, this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship.

11
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:13,971
The whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record, the ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the masthead.

12
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:19,237
still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Galapagos therapin.

13
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:34,032
For my humour's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint's eve, smoking upon the thick gilt-tiled piazza of the Golden Inn.

14
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:41,460
Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me.

15
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,087
and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.

16
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:59,998
Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the town Hoe, sperm-whaler of Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here.

17
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,084
Not very many days sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn.

18
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:08,747
She was somewhere to the northward of the line.

19
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:17,877
One morning, upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common.

20
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:47,931
They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her gentleman, but they kept in having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes, and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruises, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals, but no good luck came remordon.

21
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:51,815
went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased.

22
00:03:52,736 --> 00:04:03,707
So much so, that now, taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbour among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.

23
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:14,357
Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commoner's chance favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way,

24
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:27,478
because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those six and thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free, never mind if the leak should double on her.

25
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:41,880
In truth, while nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the town hoe had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality.

26
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:54,178
Had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Ragney, the mate, a vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.

27
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,486
Lakeman, Buffalo, pray, what is a lakeman, and where is Buffalo?"

28
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:03,953
said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.

29
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:08,780
On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don, I crave your courtesy, may be.

30
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,344
You shall soon hear further of all that.

31
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:22,319
Now, gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callow, to far Manila.

32
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:26,886
This Lake Man, in the land-locked heart of our America,

33
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:33,792
had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian free-booting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean.

34
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:52,823
For in their interflowing aggregate those grand freshwater seas of ours, Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan, possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the ocean's noblest traits, with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes.

35
00:05:53,225 --> 00:06:02,358
They contain round archipelagos of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters, due in large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is Dee.

36
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:14,895
The furnished long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east, dotted all round their banks, Horry, and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinac,

37
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:23,267
The eave heard the fleet thund'rings of naval victories from Harries to Baton, the east the travels they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red-painted faces flash.

38
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:32,499
Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkelt was wild ocean-born, and wild ocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any.

39
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:38,908
And for Rodney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach,

40
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:40,892
to nurse at his maternal sea.

41
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:57,910
Though in afterlife he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific, yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seamen, fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn-handled bowie-knives.

42
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:15,940
Yet was this Nantucktyr a man with some good-hearted traits, and this lake-man, a mariner, who, though a sort of devil indeed, might get, by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition, which is the meanest slave's rights thus treated.

43
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,387
The steel-kilt had long been retained harmless and docile.

44
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:25,317
At all events he had proved so thus far, but Ratney was doomed and made mad.

45
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:40,165
And still killed, but, gentlemen, you shall hear, it was not more than a day or two, at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven, that the town ho's leak seemed again increasing.

46
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:44,791
But only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day.

47
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:57,487
You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it, though of a still, sleepy night.

48
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:08,481
Should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it.

49
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:12,587
on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.

50
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:26,867
Nor in the solitary and savage seas, far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length.

51
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:34,738
That is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them,

52
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:46,943
It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out-of-the-way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.

53
00:08:47,284 --> 00:09:00,743
Much this way had it been with the town hoe, so when her leak was found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company, especially by Radney the mate.

54
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:08,614
He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home in yew, and every way expanded to the breeze.

55
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:23,102
Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness, touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or on sea.

56
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:26,027
But you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen."

57
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:37,548
Therefore, when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her.

58
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:45,782
So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small gamesomeness slyly going on among them.

59
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:53,813
as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling, clear water, clear as any mountain spring.

60
00:09:54,714 --> 00:10:03,085
Gentlemen, that bubbling from the pumps, ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.

61
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:10,555
Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world, of ours, watery or otherwise,

62
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:24,274
that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness

63
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:33,142
I think there's a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it.

64
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:48,220
Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events steel-kilt was a tall and noble animal, with a head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last Viceroy's snorting charger.

65
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:57,366
And a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, Which had made steel-kilt Charlemagne, Had he been born son to Charlemagne's father.

66
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:03,478
but Radney the mate was ugly as a mule, yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.

67
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,624
He did not love still-kilt, and still-coat knew it.

68
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:19,101
Aspying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest, the lakeman affected not to notice him, but, unawed, went on with his gay banterings.

69
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:23,873
Ay, ay, my merry lads, it's a lively neat this-hole, Le Canican.

70
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:26,720
One of ye, and let's have a taste.

71
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,065
Why, the Lord, it's worth bottling.

72
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:34,238
I tell ye what, men, Old Dread's investment must go for it.

73
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:37,461
He had best cut away his part of the haul and tow it home.

74
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:41,224
The fact is, boys, that Swordfish only began the job.

75
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:55,217
He's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters, Sawfish and Filefish, and what not Nod Posse of them are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom, making improvements, I suppose.

76
00:11:55,898 --> 00:12:00,002
If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter him.

77
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:03,465
They're playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him.

78
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:08,359
But he's a simple old soul, rad, and a beauty, too.

79
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:13,406
Boys, they say, the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses.

80
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,512
I wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose."

81
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,695
"'Damn your eyes!

82
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:21,498
What's that pump stopping for?'

83
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:25,183
roared Radney, pretending not to have heard the sailor's talk.

84
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:26,906
Thunder away at it."

85
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,933
"'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steel-Kilt, merry as a cricket.

86
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:33,916
Lively, boys, lively now!"

87
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:48,802
And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines, the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's utmost energies.

88
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:57,297
Quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band, the lake-man went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windless

89
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:04,415
his face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow.

90
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:12,064
Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state!

91
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:16,128
I know not, oak, but so it happened.

92
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:26,760
And now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household work, which, in all times but raging gales, is regularly attended to every evening.

93
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:32,697
hit has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time.

94
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:45,112
Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen, some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces.

95
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:53,001
But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.

96
00:13:52,981 --> 00:14:03,939
Besides, it was the stronger men in the town hoe that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps, and being the most athletic seamen of them all.

97
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,647
Steel-Kilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs.

98
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:18,904
Consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades.

99
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:25,615
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.

100
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:28,881
But there was more than this cause.

101
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:37,956
The order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting an insult-steel kilt as though Rodney had spat in his face.

102
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:45,764
Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this, and all this, and, doubtless, much more."

103
00:14:46,345 --> 00:15:04,483
The lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command, but as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow match silently burning along towards them, as he instinctively saw all this,

104
00:15:04,463 --> 00:15:20,086
That strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness, in any already ireful being the repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over steel.

105
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:27,417
Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in,

106
00:15:27,397 --> 00:15:33,750
He answered him, saying that sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.

107
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:46,317
And then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers, who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day.

108
00:15:46,297 --> 00:16:04,069
To this Rodney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner, unconditionally reiterating his command, meanwhile advancing upon the still-seated lakeman, with an uplifted Cooper's Club hammer, which he had snatched from a cask nearby.

109
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:34,056
Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the palms, for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance, the sweating steel-kilt could but ill-brook this bearing in the mate, but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking, he remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed radknee shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.

110
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:45,712
Steel-kilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his intention not to obey.

111
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:58,170
Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intonation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man.

112
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:17,290
But it was to no purpose, and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass, when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humour, the lakeman paused on the hatches, and thus spoke to the officer,

113
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:33,473
Mr. S-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

114
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:58,435
Meanwhile, repeating a string of insufferable maledictions, retreating not the thousandth part of an inch, stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poignard of his glance, Steel-Kilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek, he Steel-Kilt would murder him.

115
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:03,460
Ah, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods.

116
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,506
Immediately the hammer touched the cheek.

117
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:10,813
The next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head.

118
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:15,121
E. E. fell on the hatch, spouting blood like a whale.

119
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:24,238
Ere the cry could go aft, Steel-Kilt was shaking one of the back stays, leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads.

120
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:27,844
They were both canallers.

121
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:35,032
"'Cannulers,' cried Don Penrose, "'we have seen many whale-ships in our harbours, but never heard of your canalers.

122
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:37,495
Pardon who and what are they?'

123
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:43,602
"'Canals, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.

124
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:45,063
You must have heard of it.'

125
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:53,072
"'Nay, Signior Hereabouts, in this dull, warm, most lazy and hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous north.'

126
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:56,817
I will, then, Don, refill my cup.

127
00:18:56,837 --> 00:19:07,388
Your seat is very fine, and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our canals are, for such information may throw sidelight upon my story.

128
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:19,060
For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth of the State of New York, through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages, through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent, cultivated fields,

129
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:37,384
Unrivaled for fertility for fertility, And by billiard-room and ballroom, And through the holy of holies of great forests, And gnomon arches over Indian rivers, Through sun shade by hearts or broken hearts, Are broken through all the wide contrasting scenery Of those noble Mohawk counties, And especially by rows of snow-white.

130
00:19:37,404 --> 00:19:38,946
There's your true Ashanti.

131
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:43,832
Gentlemen, there howl your pagans, Where you ever find them.

132
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:49,880
Next door, to you, not dur the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronizing lee of churches.

133
00:19:50,041 --> 00:20:03,559
For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters, that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.

134
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,462
Is that a friar passing?"

135
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:10,431
said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the crowded plaza with humorous concern.

136
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:16,021
"'Well, for our northern friend, damn Isabella's inquisition wins in Lima!'

137
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:17,523
laughed Don Sebastian.

138
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:19,166
Proceed, Signor."

139
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:21,470
"'A moment, pardon!'

140
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:25,497
cried another of the company, in the name of all usly maids.

141
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:36,661
I but desire to express to you, Sir Sailor, that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison.

142
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:40,309
Oh, do not bow and look surprised.

143
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:44,498
You know the proverb all along this coast of corruptest Lima.

144
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,421
It but bears out your saying.

145
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:53,051
Two churches, more plentiful than billiard-tables, and forever open and corrupt as Lima.

146
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,132
So too Venice.

147
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:58,899
I have been there, the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.

148
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:00,181
Mark, St.

149
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:00,642
Dominic.

150
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:01,363
Purge it.

151
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:02,545
Your cup.

152
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,106
Thanks, sir.

153
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:03,987
I refill now.

154
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:05,108
You pour out again.

155
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:08,173
Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen.

156
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:14,964
The Caneller would make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he.

157
00:21:15,164 --> 00:21:31,883
Like Mark Antony, for day and days along his green-turfed flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck, but ashore all this effeminacy is dashed

158
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:39,895
The brigandish guise which the Canella so proudly sports, his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features.

159
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:50,111
A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats, his swort visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities.

160
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:55,980
Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these canallers.

161
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:12,570
I thank him heartily, would vain be not ungrateful, but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one.

162
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:18,981
In some, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by this.

163
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:30,978
that our wild whale fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains.

164
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:43,956
Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal

165
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:55,936
furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian cornfield and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.—'I see, I see!'

166
00:22:55,996 --> 00:23:01,725
impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles.

167
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,242
no need to travel.

168
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:04,664
The world's one Lima.

169
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:10,433
I had thought now that at your temperate north the generations were cold and holy as the hills.

170
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:15,401
But the story— I left off, gentlemen, where the lake-men shook the back-stay.

171
00:23:15,982 --> 00:23:24,996
Hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck.

172
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:36,147
but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.

173
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:47,980
Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued, while standing out of harm's way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike.

174
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:55,889
calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck.

175
00:23:55,969 --> 00:24:09,225
At intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying, but Steel-Kilt and his desperadoes were too much for them, all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck,

176
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:20,143
where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.

177
00:24:20,163 --> 00:24:21,946
"'Come out of that, ye pirates!'

178
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:29,037
roared the captain, now menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.

179
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:32,541
Come out of that, he cutthroats!"

180
00:24:32,682 --> 00:24:49,843
Steel-Kilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the worst the pistols could do, but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his Steel-Kilt's death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands.

181
00:24:50,093 --> 00:24:59,833
Hearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.

182
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:03,461
"'Will you promise not to touch us if we do?'

183
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,104
demanded their ringleader.

184
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:06,988
"'Turn to—'

185
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:10,453
Chaunce, I make no promise to your duty.

186
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:14,759
Do you want to sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this?

187
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,384
Turns to—and he wants more raised epistle.

188
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:20,988
Sink the ship, crad-steel kilt?

189
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:27,237
Ay, let us sink— Not a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us.

190
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:28,839
What say ye, men?"

191
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,643
Turning to his comrades.

192
00:25:31,623 --> 00:25:33,465
A fierce cheer was their response.

193
00:25:33,646 --> 00:25:40,895
The lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the captain, and jerking out such sentences as these.

194
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:44,419
It's not our fault we didn't want it.

195
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:47,644
I told him to take his hammer away.

196
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:49,586
It was boys' business.

197
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:52,230
He'd help have known me before this.

198
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,913
We told him not to prick the buffalo.

199
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:59,681
Ye believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw, ye?

200
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:03,568
E'en those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men.

201
00:26:03,588 --> 00:26:05,531
Look to those hand-spikes, my hearties.

202
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:08,516
Captain, by God, look to yourself.

203
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:09,117
Say the word.

204
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:10,299
Don't be a fool.

205
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,561
Forget it all.

206
00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:13,064
We are ready to turn to.

207
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:18,673
Tread us decently, and we're your men, but we won't be flocked.

208
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:20,315
"'Ten-two,' I make no promises.

209
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:21,477
"'Ten-two,' I say."

210
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:31,172
"'Look ye now,' cried the lake-man, flinging out his arm towards him, "'there are a few of us here, and I am one of them, who have shipped for the cruise.

211
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:32,473
D.C.

212
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:38,282
Now, as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down.

213
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:40,268
So we don't want a row.

214
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:41,952
It's not our interest.

215
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,262
We want to be peaceable.

216
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:48,791
We ready to work, but we won't be flogged."

217
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:53,284
Steel-Kill's glance drowned him a moment, and then said,

218
00:26:53,264 --> 00:27:02,195
I tell you what it is now, captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we won't lift a hand against you, unless you attack us.

219
00:27:02,876 --> 00:27:08,222
But till you say the word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's turn.

220
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:14,249
Down into the fore-castle, then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there till ye're sick of it.

221
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,352
Down ye go.

222
00:27:16,332 --> 00:27:17,013
Shall we?"

223
00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:19,016
cried the ringleader to his men.

224
00:27:19,156 --> 00:27:30,813
Most of them were against it, but at length, in obedience to steel-kilt, they preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.

225
00:27:31,174 --> 00:27:38,965
As the lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks, the captain and his posse leaped the barricade,

226
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:51,682
and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companion way.

227
00:27:51,822 --> 00:28:04,058
Then opening the slide a little, a captain whispered something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them, ten in number leaving on deck some twenty or more,

228
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:06,502
who thus far had remained neutral.

229
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:13,653
All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft, especially about the fort.

230
00:28:13,673 --> 00:28:28,375
But the hours of darkness passed in peace, the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.

231
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:37,213
At sunrise the captain went forward, and, knocking on the deck, summoned the prisoners to work, but with a yell they refused.

232
00:28:37,393 --> 00:28:46,532
Water was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of disket were tossed after it, when again turning the key upon them.

233
00:28:46,512 --> 00:28:50,839
and, pocketing it, the captain returned to the quarter-deck.

234
00:28:50,919 --> 00:29:09,229
Twice every day for three days this was repeated, but on the fourth morning confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered, and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.

235
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:19,919
closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at discretion.

236
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,973
Emboldened by this, the Captain resiterated his demand to the rest.

237
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:32,346
But Steel-Kilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged.

238
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:39,499
On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them.

239
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,663
Only three were left.

240
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,481
better turn to—now?"

241
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:46,885
said the captain, with a heartless jeer.

242
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:49,509
"'Shut us up again, Wilney!'

243
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,311
cried Steel-kill.

244
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:52,293
Oh, certainly!"

245
00:29:52,814 --> 00:29:54,696
The captain and the key clicked.

246
00:29:55,017 --> 00:30:03,870
It was at this point, gentlemen, that, enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him,

247
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:17,453
and, maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair, it was then that Steelkilt's proposed to the two cannellers—thus far, apparently, of one mind with him—to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison.

248
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:27,310
And on the gonch, the bronch, on the A, mincing-knives, lung, chrysanthic heavy implements, with a handle at each end, running for himself, he would do this, he said.

249
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,012
whether they joined him or not.

250
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:33,799
That was the last night he should spend in that den.

251
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:37,184
But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two.

252
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:44,314
They swore they were ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.

253
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:54,428
And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first men on deck, when the time to make the rush should come.

254
00:30:54,408 --> 00:31:17,395
But to this their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself, particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter when mother could not be first, for the latter would but admit one man at a time, and here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.

255
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:41,880
Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of treachery, namely, a beforemost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender, to and thereby secure, whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit.

256
00:31:42,299 --> 00:32:10,163
But when still Kilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last, they, in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villainy, mixed their before-secret treacheries together, and, when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences, and wound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords, and Vange shrieked out for the captain at midnight.

257
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:19,912
Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all his armed mates and hapunias rushed for the forecastle.

258
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:29,240
In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still-struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perch.

259
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:40,150
But all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle, and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen-rigging like three-quarters of meat.

260
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,598
And there they hung till morning.—'Damn ye!'

261
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:46,925
cried the captain, pacing to and fro before them.

262
00:32:47,326 --> 00:32:49,892
The vultures would not touch ye villains.

263
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:58,290
At sunrise he summoned all hands, and, separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny,

264
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:03,018
He told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round thought.

265
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:07,986
Upon the whole, he would do so, he ought to just as demanded.

266
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:18,945
But, for the present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.

267
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:34,673
But as for you, ye carrion rogues, turning to the three men in the rigging for you, I mean to mince ye up for the tripots, and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traders.

268
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:42,064
till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn.

269
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:52,220
My own wrist is sprained with ye, he cried, at last, but there is still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn't give up.

270
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,268
Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.

271
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:12,912
For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws, and then, painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort of hiss, What I say is this, and mind it well if you flog me, I murder you.

272
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:14,013
Say ye so?

273
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:18,497
Then see how ye frightened me, and the captain drew off with the rope to strike.

274
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,960
Best not, hissed the lakeman.

275
00:34:22,981 --> 00:34:27,004
But I must, and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.

276
00:34:27,124 --> 00:34:42,898
Steel-kilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the captain, who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly, throwing down his rope, said, I won't do it, let him go cut him, down quarter here.

277
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:45,522
Not days," cried John.

278
00:34:45,642 --> 00:34:54,896
But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pal man with a bandaged head arrested Den Radney, the chief mine.

279
00:34:55,056 --> 00:34:59,503
Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth, but that morning

280
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:06,012
Hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene.

281
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:16,205
Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt.

282
00:35:16,225 --> 00:35:19,690
He snatched the rope and advanced to his pinion foe.

283
00:35:21,272 --> 00:35:24,537
You are a coward, hissed the lakeman.

284
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:27,060
So I am, but take that.

285
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:32,404
The mate was in the very act of striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm.

286
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:40,557
He paused, and then paused no more, made good his word, spite of Steel-Kilt's threat, whatever that might have been.

287
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:50,533
The three men were then cut down, all hands returned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps claimed as before.

288
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:56,183
Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was heard in the fore.

289
00:35:56,203 --> 00:36:04,517
Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in the ship's run for salvation.

290
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:09,045
Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest.

291
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:23,940
On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steel-Kilt's instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body.

292
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:35,151
But, in order to ensure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing, namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered.

293
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:56,211
For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the town host still maintained her mastheads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground, and Rodney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat.

294
00:36:56,191 --> 00:37:01,960
and, with his bandaged mouth, seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.

295
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:21,152
But, though the lake-men had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel, at least till all was over, concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart.

296
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:29,952
He was in Radney the chief mate's watch, and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half-way to meet his doom.

297
00:37:30,894 --> 00:37:39,293
After the scene at the rigging he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night.

298
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:46,304
Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steel-Kilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.

299
00:37:46,664 --> 00:38:00,285
During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side.

300
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:05,533
In this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed.

301
00:38:05,513 --> 00:38:12,402
There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea.

302
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:25,560
Steel-killed calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the morning of the third day, from that in which he had been betrayed.

303
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,588
At his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below.

304
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:34,170
"'What are you making there?'

305
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:35,412
said a ship-mate.

306
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:37,416
"'What do you think?

307
00:38:37,436 --> 00:38:38,598
What does it look like?'

308
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:43,908
"'Like a lanyard for your bag, but it's an odd one, seems to me.'

309
00:38:43,928 --> 00:38:49,158
"'Yes, rather oddish,' said the lake-man, holding it at arm's length before him.

310
00:38:49,178 --> 00:38:52,885
"'But I think it will answer.'

311
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:54,247
I haven't enough twine.

312
00:38:54,588 --> 00:38:55,229
Have you any?"

313
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,693
But there was none in the fort.

314
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:02,020
"'E don't mean to go out begging to him,' said the sailor.

315
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,182
"'Why not?

316
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:09,473
Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's to help himself in the end, shipmate?'

317
00:39:09,453 --> 00:39:15,744
And going to the mate, he looked at him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock.

318
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:31,393
It was given him, neither twine nor lanyard were seen again, but the next night an iron ball, closely knitted, partly rolled from the pocket of the lakeman's monkey-jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow.

319
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:53,870
Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent Helm nigh, to the man, who was apt to doze over the grave, always ready dug, to the seaman's hand that fatal hour, was then to come, and, in the foreordaining soul of steel-kilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.

320
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:55,272
But, gentlemen,

321
00:39:55,252 --> 00:40:13,935
A fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned, yet complete revenge he had, and without being the avenger, for, by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done.

322
00:40:14,185 --> 00:40:28,442
It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriff man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, There she rolls!

323
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:31,249
There she rolls!

324
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,671
"'Jesu, what a whale!

325
00:40:33,052 --> 00:40:33,973
It was Moby Dick!'

326
00:40:33,994 --> 00:40:35,456
"'Moby Dick!'

327
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:36,898
cried Don Sebastian, St.

328
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:37,459
Dominic.

329
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,244
"'Sir Sailor, but do whales have christenings?

330
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:42,247
Whom call you Moby Dick?

331
00:40:42,828 --> 00:40:46,193
A very white and famous and most deadly and immortal monster!

332
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:48,738
Don that would be too long a story!'

333
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:50,721
"'How, how!'

334
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:53,305
cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.

335
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:58,334
Nay, don, don, nay, nay, I cannot rehearse that now.

336
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:00,637
Let me get more into the air, sirs.

337
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:03,320
The chicha, the chicha!"

338
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,164
cried Don Pedro, ere a vigorous friend looks faint fill up his empty glass.

339
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:11,468
No need, gentlemen, one moment, and I proceed.

340
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:22,380
Now, gentlemen, so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale, within fifty yards of the ship forgetful, of the compact among the crew in the excitement of the moment,

341
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:34,238
The Tenerife man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mastheads.

342
00:41:34,899 --> 00:41:36,402
All was now a frenzy.

343
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:38,785
The white whale, the white whale!

344
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:48,300
was the cry from Captain Mace and Harpeniers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish.

345
00:41:48,280 --> 00:42:03,640
While the dogged crew I disgance, and with curses The appalling beauty of the vast milky mess That lit up by a horizontal spangling sun Shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea.

346
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:12,952
Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.

347
00:42:13,173 --> 00:42:27,872
The mutineer was the bowsman of the might, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command.

348
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:37,726
Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mates got the start, and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steel-Kilt, as he strained at his oar.

349
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:45,758
After a stiff pull, their harpoonier got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow.

350
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:54,130
He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat, and now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale's topmost back.

351
00:42:54,565 --> 00:43:09,925
Nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together, till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over spilled out the standing meat.

352
00:43:09,905 --> 00:43:22,880
That instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale.

353
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:31,710
He struck out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, mildly seeking to remove himself.

354
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,412
from the eye of Moby Dick.

355
00:43:33,432 --> 00:43:44,284
But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom, seized the swimmer between his jaws, and, rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again and went down.

356
00:43:44,444 --> 00:43:54,255
Meantime, at the first tap of the bow's bottom, the lakeman had slackened the line so as to drop a stern from the whirlpool, calmly looking on.

357
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:55,778
He thought his own thoughts.

358
00:43:56,439 --> 00:44:02,571
But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line.

359
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:05,216
He cut it, and the whale was free.

360
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:14,995
But at some distance Moby Dick rose again, with some tattoos of Radney's red woolen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him.

361
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:21,781
All four boats gave chase again, but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.

362
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:29,508
In good time the town hall reached her port, the savage, solitary place where no civilized creature resided.

363
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:44,982
There, headed by the lake-men, all but five or six of the four mess-men deliberately deserted among the palms, eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor.

364
00:44:44,962 --> 00:45:02,160
The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak, but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies

365
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:21,702
Was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel.

366
00:45:21,682 --> 00:45:50,659
After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far offshore as possible, loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows, stacked his muskets on the poop, and, warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.

367
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:58,693
Well, on the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was described, which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.

368
00:45:59,595 --> 00:46:09,632
He steered away from it, but the savage craft bore down on him, and soon the voice of steel-kilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water.

369
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:12,377
The captain presented a pistol.

370
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:24,907
With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lake then laughed him to scorn, assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.

371
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:28,171
"'What do you want of me?'

372
00:46:28,511 --> 00:46:29,312
cried the Captain.

373
00:46:29,332 --> 00:46:31,895
"'Where are you bound, and for what are you bound?'

374
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:34,618
demanded Steel-Kilt, no lies.

375
00:46:35,847 --> 00:46:38,050
I am bound to Tahiti for more men."

376
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,473
"'Very good.

377
00:46:39,853 --> 00:46:41,015
Let me board you a moment.

378
00:46:41,115 --> 00:46:41,896
I come in peace.'

379
00:46:42,077 --> 00:46:49,348
With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat, and, climbing the dunnel, stood face to face with the captain.

380
00:46:49,368 --> 00:46:51,311
"'Cross your arms, sir.

381
00:46:51,972 --> 00:46:52,853
Throw back your head.

382
00:46:53,635 --> 00:46:55,317
Now repeat after me.

383
00:46:55,437 --> 00:47:01,807
As soon as Steel-Kilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on Yonder Island and remain there six days.

384
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:03,610
If I do not,

385
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:05,594
may lightning strike me."

386
00:47:06,816 --> 00:47:09,080
"'A pretty scholar,' laughed the lake-man.

387
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:10,562
Adieu, seigneur."

388
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:19,015
And, leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades, watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees.

389
00:47:19,556 --> 00:47:27,808
Steel-kilt made sail again, and in due time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination.

390
00:47:27,788 --> 00:47:38,269
Locke befriended him, two ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed.

391
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:42,718
They embarked, and so for ever got the start of their former captain.

392
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,367
Had he been at all minded to work the legal retribution?

393
00:47:47,347 --> 00:48:00,451
Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea.

394
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:09,608
Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel, and, finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.

395
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:14,958
Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know but upon the island of Nantucket.

396
00:48:15,479 --> 00:48:25,538
The widow of Radney still turns to the sea, which refuses to give up its dead, still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him.

397
00:48:25,518 --> 00:48:26,459
"'Are you through?'

398
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,582
said Don Sebastian, quietly.

399
00:48:28,602 --> 00:48:30,184
"'I am, Don.'

400
00:48:30,204 --> 00:48:37,673
"'Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions this your story is in substance really true.

401
00:48:38,334 --> 00:48:40,056
It is so passing wonderful.

402
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:43,100
Did you get it from an unquestionable source?

403
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:45,383
Bear with me if I seem to press—'

404
00:48:45,363 --> 00:48:54,355
Also bear with all of us, sir, sailor, for we all join in Don Sebastian's suit," cried the company, with exceeding interest.

405
00:48:54,816 --> 00:48:59,322
Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelist in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?

406
00:48:59,662 --> 00:49:07,152
Nay, said Don Sebastian, but I know a worthy priest nearby who will quickly procure one for me.

407
00:49:07,132 --> 00:49:08,137
I go for it.

408
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:09,985
But are you well advised?

409
00:49:10,468 --> 00:49:11,854
This may grow too serious.

410
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:15,471
Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?"

411
00:49:16,227 --> 00:49:25,901
Though there are no autodefes in Lima now," said one of the company to another, I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy.

412
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:28,544
Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight.

413
00:49:29,105 --> 00:49:30,247
I see no need of this.

414
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:41,863
Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian, but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest-sized evangelists you can.

415
00:49:41,843 --> 00:49:42,744
"'This is the priest.

416
00:49:43,044 --> 00:49:45,627
He brings you the evangelist,' said Don Sebastian.

417
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:52,075
Gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure, "'Let me remove my hat.

418
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:59,102
Now, venerable priest, further into the light, and hold the holy book before me, that I may touch it.

419
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:07,632
So help me, Heaven, and on my honour the story I have told ye, gentlemen, is in substance and its great items true.'"

420
00:50:07,612 --> 00:50:08,858
I know it to be true.

421
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,587
It happened on this ball.

422
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,115
I trod the ship.

423
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:13,462
I knew the crew.

424
00:50:13,884 --> 00:50:18,347
I have seen and talked with Stilkilt since the death of Radney.
