CHAPTER XXXIX.

2
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:02,114
FIRST NIGHT WATCH.

3
00:00:02,394 --> 00:00:02,915
FORETOP.

4
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,637
STUBB'S SOLACE.

5
00:00:04,657 --> 00:00:06,079
AND MENDINA BRACE.

6
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:06,820
Ha!

7
00:00:07,602 --> 00:00:08,042
ha!

8
00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:08,823
came up my throat.

9
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:11,908
I've been thinking over it ever since, and that ha!

10
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:12,208
ha!

11
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:13,550
is the final consequence.

12
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,531
Why so?

13
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:26,528
Because eight laughs the wisest, easiest answer to all that's queer, and come what will, one comfort's always left, that unfailing comfort is, it's all predestinated.

14
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:34,459
I heard not all his talk with Starbuck, but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something, as I the other evening felt.

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,704
Be sure the old mogul has fixed him, too.

16
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:45,394
I twigged it, knew it, had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it, for when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it.

17
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:51,082
Well, Stubb—wise Stubb—that's my title, well, Stubb—what of it, Stubb?

18
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:53,005
Here's a carcass.

19
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:58,091
I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I'll go to it laughing.

20
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:01,935
Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles.

21
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:03,437
I feel funny.

22
00:01:04,058 --> 00:01:06,480
Fa la leera skeera!

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,265
What's my juicy little pear at home doing now, crying its eyes out?

24
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:16,832
Giving a party to the last-arrived harpooneers, I dare say gay as a frigate's pennant, and so am I far.

25
00:01:16,812 --> 00:01:29,923
We'll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love, as gay and fleeting, As bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim, And break on the lips while meeting.

26
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:33,591
A brave stave that who calls, Mr. Starbuck?

27
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:36,117
Ay, ay, Sir Ocite is my superior.

28
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:38,763
He has his, too, if I'm not mistaken.

29
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:42,853
Ay, ay, sir, just through with this job coming.
