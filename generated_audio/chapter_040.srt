Chapter 40 - Midnight. Forecastle Harponiers and Sailors Foresail Rises and Discovers The Watch Standing, Lunging, Leaning, and Lying in Various Attitudes All Singing in Chorus

2
00:00:15,472 --> 00:00:17,835
Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies.

3
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:21,160
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,042
Our captains commanded.

5
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,846
One Sistine, Nantucket sailor.

6
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:28,550
Oh, boys, don't be sentimental.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,032
It's bad for the digestion.

8
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:31,233
Take a tonic.

9
00:00:31,494 --> 00:00:31,994
Follow me.

10
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:35,539
S-I-N-G's and all follow.

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:43,059
Our captain stood upon the deck, a spyglass in his hand, a viewing of those gallant whales that blew at every strand.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:51,571
Oh, your tubs and your boats, my boys, and by your braces stand, and we'll have one of those fine whales hand, boys, over hand.

13
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,255
So be cheery, my lads, may your hearts never fail.

14
00:00:56,137 --> 00:01:01,003
While the bold harpooner is striking the whale, mate's voice from the quarter deck,

15
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:02,985
Eight bells there, forward.

16
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,507
To N.D., Nantucket sailor.

17
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:07,128
Avast the chorus.

18
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:08,610
Eight bells there.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,091
Die here, bellboy.

20
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,793
Strike the bell eight, thou pip, thou blackling.

21
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:14,475
And let me call the watch.

22
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:16,336
I've the sort of mouth for that.

23
00:01:16,737 --> 00:01:17,817
The hog's head mouth.

24
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:20,980
So, so, truss his head down the scuttle.

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,643
Starbow, L-E-E-N-S-A-O-U-Y.

26
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:26,265
Eight bells there, below.

27
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:30,028
Tumble up, D-U eight bells there, below.

28
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:32,852
Grand snoozing to-night, matey, fat night for that.

29
00:01:33,453 --> 00:01:38,279
I mark this in our old mogul's wine, it's quite as deadening to some as Philipping to others.

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,422
We sing, they sleep.

31
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:43,887
Ay, lie down there, like ground-tier butts.

32
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:45,068
At'em again.

33
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:48,132
There, take this copper pump and hail'em through it.

34
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:50,596
Tell'em to avast dreaming of their lasses.

35
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:54,541
Tell'em it's the resurrection they must kiss their last and come to judgment.

36
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:56,083
That's the way.

37
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:00,435
That's it, thy throat ain't spoiled with eating Amsterdam butter.

38
00:02:01,036 --> 00:02:01,758
French sailor.

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,549
Hist, boys, let's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay.

40
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,371
What say ye?

41
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:09,135
There comes the other watch.

42
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:11,060
Stand by, all legs.

43
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:14,207
Pip, little Pip, hurrah with your tambourine.

44
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:17,293
P.I.P., sulky and sleepy, don't know where it is.

45
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:20,780
French sailor, beat thy belly then, and wag thy ears.

46
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,906
Jigot men, I say, marries the word, hurrah.

47
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:25,469
Damn me, won't you dance?

48
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,936
Form, now Indian file, and gallop into the double shuffle.

49
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:34,407
Throw yourselves, legs, legs, legs, legs, legs, legs.

50
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,688
Iceland, sailor.

51
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,490
I don't like your floor, matey.

52
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,272
It's too springy to my taste.

53
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:40,694
I'm used to ice floor.

54
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:41,355
Hurrah!

55
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:45,199
I'm sorry to throw cold water on the subject, but excuse me.

56
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,440
Malta's sailor.

57
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:47,562
Me too.

58
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:48,623
Where's your girls?

59
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:54,069
Who but a fool would take his left hand by his right and say to himself, how'd I do?

60
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:54,950
Partners.

61
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,952
I must have partners.

62
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:58,254
Sicilian sailor.

63
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,277
Aye, girls in a green.

64
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:03,241
Then I'll hop with ye, yea, turn grasshopper.

65
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:04,063
Long.

66
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:05,545
Island sailor.

67
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:08,669
Well, well, ye sulkies, there's plenty more of us.

68
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,877
Ho corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon.

69
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:22,064
Ah, here comes the music, now for it, A-Z-O's sailor, Ascending and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle.

70
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:26,508
Here you are, Pip, and there's the windlass bits, Up you mount.

71
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:34,155
Now, boys, the half of them Dance to the tambourine, some go below, Some sleep or lie among the coils of rigging.

72
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:41,822
Oats a-plenty, oats a-plenty, oats a-billow, Oats a-plenty, a bill-boy,

73
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:45,386
Rigot, digot, stigot, quigot, digot, stigot, quigot.

74
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:48,470
The hulf of them dance to the tambourine.

75
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:51,454
Some go below, some sleep or long.

76
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,456
Make fireflies, break the jinglers.

77
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:55,379
Pip, jinglers you say.

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,683
There goes another, dropped off, I pound it so.

79
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:02,928
China, sailor, rattle thy teeth then and pound away.

80
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:05,211
Make a pagoda of thyself.

81
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,197
French sailor.

82
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:07,279
Merry mad.

83
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,624
Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it.

84
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:10,546
Split jibs.

85
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:11,528
Tear yourselves.

86
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:12,831
Tash to go.

87
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:13,893
Quietly.

88
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:14,514
Smoking.

89
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:15,456
That's a white man.

90
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,598
He calls that fun.

91
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,480
Humpf!

92
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,322
I save my sweat.

93
00:04:18,522 --> 00:04:18,783
Fun!

94
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:19,204
Humpf!

95
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:20,426
I save my sweat.

96
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:22,290
Old, manic sailor.

97
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:26,659
I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over.

98
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:33,382
I'll dance over your grave, I will, that's the bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat headwinds round corners.

99
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:37,829
O Christ, to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews!

100
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:44,359
Well, well, be like the whole world's a ball as you scholars have it, and so tis right to make one ballroom of it.

101
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,343
Dance on, lads, you're young, I was once.

102
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:51,049
3-D Nantucket Sailor Spell O!

103
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:51,910
Hugh!

104
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:55,836
This is worse than pulling after whales in a calm.

105
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:57,097
Give us a whiff, Tash.

106
00:04:57,638 --> 00:05:00,281
The H is dancing and gathering clusters.

107
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:04,405
Meantime, the sky darkens, the wind rises.

108
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:10,011
Laskar Sailor By Brahma, boys, it'll be dowsail soon.

109
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:13,555
The sky-born, high-tide Ganges turn to wind.

110
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:16,198
Thou showest thy black brow, Siva.

111
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:21,083
Maltus Sailor Reclining and shaking his cap, it's the waves.

112
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:23,646
The snow's caps turn to jigot now.

113
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:31,137
They'll shake their tassels soon, now would all the waves were women, Then I'd go drown and chassis with them evermore.

114
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:43,576
There's not so sweet on earth, heaven may not match it, As those swift glances of warm wild bosoms in the dance, When the over-arbouring arms hide such ripe bursting grapes.

115
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,621
S. I. Sillian, Sailor.

116
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,283
Reclining.

117
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:49,346
Tell me not of it.

118
00:05:49,927 --> 00:06:00,314
Hark ye, lad, Fleet interlacings of the limbs, Live swayings, coyings, flutterings, Lip, heart, hip, all graze Unceasing touch and go.

119
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:04,264
Not taste, observe ye, Else come satiety.

120
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:05,145
Eh, pagan?

121
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:06,327
Nudging.

122
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:07,889
Tahitian Sailor.

123
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:16,562
Reclining on a mat, Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls, The heva, heva, ah, low-veiled, high-palmed Tahiti.

124
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:20,367
I still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid.

125
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:27,197
I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat, Green the first day I brought ye thence, Now worn and wilted quite.

126
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:30,742
Ah, me, not thou nor I can bear the change.

127
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:31,703
How then?

128
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,930
If so, be transplanted to Yonskai.

129
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:37,181
How, then, if so be transplanted to Kai Rai Quark?

130
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:45,186
Here I the roaring streams from Pyrohyte's peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages.

131
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:48,952
The blast, the blast, up, spine, and meet it.

132
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:50,635
Leaps to his feet.

133
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:52,317
Portuguese sailor.

134
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:55,482
How the sea rolls, swashing gainst the side.

135
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:57,625
Stand by for reefing, hearties.

136
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,968
The winds are just crossing swords.

137
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:02,092
Pell-mell, they'll go lunging presently.

138
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:03,754
Danish sailor.

139
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:05,757
Crack, crack, old ship.

140
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:08,541
So long as thou crackest, thou holdest.

141
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:09,142
Well done.

142
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:11,928
The mate there holds ye to it stiffly.

143
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:21,146
He's no more afraid than the Isle Ford at Kattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes.

144
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,488
4th Nantucket.

145
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,510
Sailor.

146
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:26,496
He has his orders, mind ye that.

147
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:32,485
I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a water spout with a pistol.

148
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:34,387
Fire your ship right into it.

149
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,290
English, sailor.

150
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:37,492
Blood.

151
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,116
But that old man's a grand old cove.

152
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:42,900
We are the lads to hunt him up his whale.

153
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,502
ALL.

154
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:45,043
Aye!

155
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:45,744
Aye!

156
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:47,266
O.L.D.

157
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:48,427
Manex Sailor.

158
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,590
How the three pines shake.

159
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:57,759
Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there's none but the crew's cursed clay.

160
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,922
Steady, helmsman, steady.

161
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:05,189
This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore and keeled hulls split at sea.

162
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,452
Our captain has his birthmark.

163
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:09,915
Look yonder, boys, there's another in the sky.

164
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:12,998
Lurid like, ye see, all else pitch black.

165
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:14,660
Daggoo, what of that?

166
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,682
Who's afraid of blacks afraid of me?

167
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:17,864
I'm quarried out of it.

168
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:19,105
Spanish sailor.

169
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:20,066
A-side.

170
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:21,247
He wants to bully.

171
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:23,590
Ah, the old grudge makes me touchy.

172
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,751
A-de-vancing.

173
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,133
I harpooneer.

174
00:08:26,313 --> 00:08:29,256
Thy race is the undeniable dark side of mankind.

175
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:30,958
Devilish dark at that.

176
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:31,699
No offense.

177
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,621
Dagoo.

178
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:33,322
Drimly.

179
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:33,984
None.

180
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:35,166
S.T.

181
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:36,127
Jago's sailor.

182
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,171
That Spaniard's mad or drunk.

183
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:44,222
But that can't be, or else in his one case our old mogul's firewaters are somewhat long and working.

184
00:08:44,242 --> 00:08:45,384
5th.

185
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:46,807
Nantucket's sailor.

186
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,069
What's that I saw?

187
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,751
Lightning?

188
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:49,492
Yes.

189
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:50,434
S.P.A.

190
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:50,834
shaler.

191
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:51,456
No.

192
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:52,778
Dagoo showing his teeth.

193
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:53,720
Dagoo.

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,022
Showing his teeth.

195
00:08:55,002 --> 00:09:00,608
Draku, a springing, Swallow thine, mannequin, White skin, white liver, S.P.

196
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:05,854
Aeschaler, meeting him, Knife thee heartily, Big frame, small spirit, A.L.

197
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:21,752
Aro, Aro, Aro, Arif, Arishe, Tash to go with a whiff, Nakus and men, both brawlers, Humph, Belfast Aeschaler, Aro, Aro, Aro, The virgin be blessed, Aro, Plunge in with ye,

198
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:30,184
E-English, sailor, fair play, Snatch the Spaniard's knife, a-ring, a-ring, O-L-D, man-ex-sailor, ready-formed.

199
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:39,538
There, the ring'd horizon, in that ring Cain struck Abel, sweet work, right work, No, why then, God, mad'st thou the ring?

200
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:49,726
Mate's voice from the quarterdeck, Hands by the halyards in top-gallant sails, Stand by to reef-top sails, A-L-L, the squall, the squall, Jump, my jollies!

201
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:54,011
They scatter, Pip, Shrinking under the windlass, Jollies?

202
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:55,713
Lord help such jollies!

203
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:57,074
Krish, crash!

204
00:09:57,575 --> 00:10:00,498
There goes the jib-stay, Blang-wang, God!

205
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:07,585
Duck lower, Pip, Here comes the royal yard, It's worse than being in the world woods The last day of the year,

206
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,549
Who'd go climbing after chestnuts now?

207
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,613
But there they go, all cursing, and here I don't.

208
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:15,477
Fine prospects to them, there on the road.

209
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:18,642
Fine prospects to them, there on the road to heaven.

210
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:21,245
Hold on, Jiminy, what a squall.

211
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:23,889
But those chaps, there are worse yet.

212
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,112
They're your white squalls, they.

213
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:29,677
White squalls, white whale, sure, sure.

214
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:35,125
Here have I heard all their chat just now, and the white whale, sure, sure.

215
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:37,488
but spoken of once and only this evening.

216
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:40,512
It makes me jingle all over like my tambourine.

217
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:44,117
That anaconda of an old man swore him in to hunt him.

218
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:51,186
Oh, thou big white god aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy down here.

219
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:55,071
Preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear.
