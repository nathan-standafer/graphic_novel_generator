CHAPTER XXVII.

2
00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:05,238
KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES Stub was the second mate.

3
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:10,806
He was a native of Cape Cod, and, hence, according to local usage, was called a Cape Codman.

4
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:27,490
A happy-go-lucky, neither craven nor valiant, taking perils as they came with an indifferent air, and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman-joiner engaged for the year.

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:37,889
Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his whale-boat, as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew all invited guests.

6
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:47,807
He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box.

7
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:58,018
When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.

8
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,966
He would hum over his old, rigidic tunes, while flink and flank with the most exasperated monster.

9
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:10,773
Long usage had, for this thub, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair.

10
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:14,537
What he thought of death itself, there is no telling.

11
00:01:14,517 --> 00:01:39,040
Whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question, but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.

12
00:01:39,172 --> 00:02:00,252
What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave peddlers, all bound to the ground with their packs, what help to bring about that almost impious good-humour of his, hot thing, must have been his pipe?

13
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:06,899
For, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.

14
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:14,808
You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe.

15
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:26,560
He kept a whole row of pipes there, ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand, and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession.

16
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:33,580
lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter, then loading them again to be in readiness anew.

17
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:41,562
For when Stub dressed, instead of first putting his legs into his trousers, he put his pipe into his mouth.

18
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:56,901
this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his peculiar disposition, for every one knows that this earthly air, whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals whom have died exhaling it.

19
00:02:57,522 --> 00:03:02,909
And, as in time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths.

20
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:11,219
S. Likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubbs's tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.

21
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:15,945
The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's vineyard.

22
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:17,607
A short, stout,

23
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:28,048
ruddy young fellow, very pagnacious concerning Wales, who somehow seemed to think that the great Leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him.

24
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:34,802
And, therefore, it was a sort of point of honour with him to destroy them whenever encountered.

25
00:03:34,816 --> 00:04:04,182
So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways, and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them, that, in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse or, at least, water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil.

26
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:10,694
This ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales.

27
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:20,933
He followed these fish for the fun of it, and a three years' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time.

28
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:28,026
As a carpenter's nails are divided into roth nails and cut nails, so mankind may be similarly divided.

29
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:31,427
The Keflask was one of the wrought ones.

30
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:55,515
Made to clinch tight and last long, they called him King Post on board of the Pequod, because, in form, he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in Arctic whalers, and which, by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas.

31
00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:00,363
Now these three mates, Starbuck, Stub, and Flask, were momentous men.

32
00:05:01,244 --> 00:05:06,833
They it was who, by universal prescription, commanded three of the Pequod's boats as headsmen.

33
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:18,432
In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies.

34
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:28,586
or, being armed with their long, keen, wailing spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers, even as the harponeers were flingers of javelins.

35
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:40,302
And since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman, like the Gothic knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harponeer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance,

36
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:57,379
When the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault again, moreover, as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness, it's therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the Pequod's harpeniers were, and to what headsmen each of them belonged.

37
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:03,831
First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for his squire.

38
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,694
But Queequeg is already known.

39
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:26,573
Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly promontory of Martha's Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboury island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers.

40
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:31,082
In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of gay-headers.

41
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:42,283
Teshtego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheekbones and black, rounding eyes for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic

42
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:58,753
In their glittering expression all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior-hunters who, in quest of the great New England moose, had scoured bow-in-hand the aboriginal forests of the Maine.

43
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:07,321
But, no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea.

44
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:28,740
The unerring harpoon of the sun, fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sire's, to look at the tawny brawn of his lie's sneaky limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and half believed this wild Indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air.

45
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,224
Tashtego was stubbed the second mate's squire.

46
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:41,495
Third among the harpooners was Dagu, a gigantic coal-black negro savage, with a lion-like tread and ahasuerus to behold.

47
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:52,208
Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them.

48
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:56,753
In his youth Dagu had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler.

49
00:07:56,733 --> 00:08:21,357
lying in a lonely bay on his native coast, and never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen, and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners, uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped, Dago retained all his barbaric virtues.

50
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:27,848
and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks.

51
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:36,904
There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him, and a white man standing before him, seeing the white flag, come to beg truth of a portrait.

52
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:46,821
Kieran Sattel, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Dagu, was the squire of Little Flask, who looked like a chessman beside him.

53
00:08:47,020 --> 00:09:04,050
As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale-fishery are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the officers are,

54
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:18,684
Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery, as with the American army, and military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American canals and railroads.

55
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:29,515
The same, I say, because in all these cases the Native American liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world is generously supplying the muscles.

56
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:42,431
No small number of these whaling seamen belonged to the Azores, where the outward-bound Nantucket whalers frequently touched to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores.

57
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:52,724
In like manner the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London put in at the Shetland Islands to receive the full complement of their crew.

58
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:57,190
Upon the passage homewards they dropped them there again.

59
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,778
How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whale-men.

60
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:05,722
They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod.

61
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:15,095
Isolatos, too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but each Isolato living on a separate continent of his own.

62
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:20,823
Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatos were!

63
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:27,092
An Anacarsis clutes deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth.

64
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:35,106
accompanying old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back.

65
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:40,997
Black little Pippi never did oh no, he went before.

66
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:46,566
Poor Alabama boy, on the grim Pequod's forecastle, Ye shall e'er long see him.

67
00:10:47,269 --> 00:11:01,855
Beating his tambourine, prelusive Of the eternal time, when sent for, To the great quarter-deck on high, He was bid striking with angels, And beat his tambourine in glory, Called a coward here, hailed a hero there.
