00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:16,015
Chapter 36 - The Quarter-Deck. Enter Ahab Then All It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his want, ascended the cabin gangway to the deck.

2
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:22,465
There most sea captains usually walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the garden.

3
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:36,923
Soon his steady ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all overdented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk.

4
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:43,662
Did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow, there also you would see still stranger footprints.

5
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:47,912
The footprints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.

6
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:55,350
But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.

7
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:15,210
And, so full of his thought was Ahab that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced, so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.

8
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:18,033
Demark him, Flask, whispered Stubb.

9
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:21,636
The chick that's in him pecks the shell, t'will soon be out.

10
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:23,498
The hours wore on.

11
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:31,745
Ahab now shut up within his cabin, Anon pacing the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.

12
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,289
It drew near the close of day.

13
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:47,410
Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the auger hole there, and with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.

14
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:54,316
said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on shipboard except in some extraordinary case.

15
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:57,700
Send everybody aft, repeated Ahab.

16
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,143
Mastheads there, come down.

17
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:11,457
When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up.

18
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:24,062
Ahab, after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from his standpoint, and as though not a soul were nigh him, resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.

19
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:38,642
With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men, till Stub cautiously whispered to Flask that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.

20
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:40,490
But this did not last long.

21
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:45,117
Vehemently pausing, he cried, What do you do when you see a whale, men?

22
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:50,305
Sing out for him, was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices.

23
00:02:50,966 --> 00:03:01,002
Good, cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones, observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them.

24
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,385
And what d'ye next, men?

25
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:04,829
Lower away, and after him.

26
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,294
And what tune is it ye pull to, men?

27
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,758
A dead whale, or a stove-boat?

28
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:16,290
More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, Grew the countenance of the old man at every shout,

29
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:25,903
while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other, as if marveling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.

30
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:38,700
But they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus.

31
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,467
All ye mastheaders have before now Heard me give orders about a white whale.

32
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:45,592
Look ye, d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?

33
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:50,681
Holding up a broad bright coin to the sun, It is a sixteen-dollar piece, men.

34
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:51,903
D'ye see it?

35
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:54,748
Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top mall.

36
00:03:54,728 --> 00:04:13,969
While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its luster, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.

37
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:42,673
Receiving the top mall from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a high-raised voice exclaiming, Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw, whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke, look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys.

38
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:43,234
Huzzah!

39
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:43,855
Huzzah!

40
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:48,983
cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.

41
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:54,972
It's a white whale, I say, resumed Ahab as he threw down the top maul a white whale.

42
00:04:55,713 --> 00:05:01,422
Skin your eyes for him, men, look sharp for white water, if ye see but a bubble, sing out.

43
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:16,409
All this while Tashtego, Dagoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection.

44
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:23,241
Captain Ahab, said Tashtego, that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick.

45
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,693
"'Moby Dick,' shouted Ahab.

46
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:28,080
"'Do you know the white whale then, Tash?'

47
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:31,811
"'Does he fantail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?'

48
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,737
said the gay-header deliberately."

49
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:36,271
And has he a curious spout, too?"

50
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:37,153
said Dagu.

51
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:41,299
Very bushy, even for a Parmaceti, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab.

52
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,108
And he have one, two, threeâ€” Oh, good many iron in him hide, too, Captain!"

53
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,830
cried Queequeg disjointedly.

54
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,314
All twiskety betwisk, like him!

55
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:52,155
Him!

56
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:59,887
faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle.

57
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:01,049
Like him!

58
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,032
Him!

59
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:03,753
"'Corkscrew!'

60
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:05,115
cried Ahab.

61
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:09,501
"'Aye, Kwikweg, the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him.

62
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:18,513
"'Aye, Dagu, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, "'and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool "'after the great annual sheep-shearing.

63
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:23,079
"'Aye, Tashtego, and he fantails like a split jib in a squall.

64
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:27,024
"'Death and devils, men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen.

65
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:29,948
"'Moby Dick, Moby Dick.

66
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:41,333
"'Captain Ahab,' said Starbuck who, with stub and flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.

67
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:47,407
"'Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick, but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg.

68
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:49,692
Who told thee that?'

69
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,532
cried Ahab, then pausing.

70
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:54,835
Ay, Starbuck, ay, my heart is all round.

71
00:06:55,416 --> 00:07:00,461
It was Moby Dick that dismasted me, Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.

72
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:06,708
Ay, ay, he shouted with a terrific, loud animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose.

73
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:14,076
Ay, ay, it was that accursed white whale that resied me, made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day.

74
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:26,287
Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations, he shouted out, I, I, and I'll chase him round Good Hope and round the Horn and round the Norway Maelstrom and round Perdition's flames before I give him up.

75
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:36,242
And this is what ye have shipped for, men, to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.

76
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:40,028
What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it now?

77
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,612
I think ye do look brave.

78
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:47,960
I, I, shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the excited old man.

79
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:52,246
A sharp eye for the white whale, a sharp lance for Moby Dick.

80
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:56,271
God bless ye, he seemed to half-sob and half-shout.

81
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:57,974
God bless ye, men.

82
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:01,058
Steward, go draw the great measure of grog.

83
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,463
But what's this long face about, Mr. Starbuck?

84
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:06,566
Wilt thou not chase the white whale?

85
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:09,510
Art not game for Moby Dick?

86
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:17,110
I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of death too, Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow.

87
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:21,602
But I came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance.

88
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:25,913
How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab?

89
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,244
It will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.

90
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:30,866
Nantucket market!

91
00:08:31,246 --> 00:08:31,567
Hoot!

92
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:33,509
But come closer, Starbuck.

93
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,692
Thou requirest a little lower layer.

94
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:50,331
If money's to be the measurer, man, and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe by girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch, then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium.

95
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:50,913
Hurry!

96
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:55,003
he smites his chest, whispered stub, what's that for?

97
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:58,211
Methinks it rings most vast, but hollow.

98
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:06,312
Vengeance on a dumb brute, cried Starbuck, that simply smote thee from blindest instinct, madness.

99
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,390
To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.

100
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:13,414
Hark ye yet again, the little lower lair.

101
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:17,298
All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks.

102
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:28,511
But in each event, in the living act, the undoubted deed, there some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the moldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask.

103
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:31,354
If man will strike, strike through the mask.

104
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:34,897
How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?

105
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:38,841
To me, the white whale is that wall shoved near to me.

106
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,343
Sometimes I think there's naught beyond.

107
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:42,725
But tis enough.

108
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:48,930
He tasks me, he heaps me, I see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it.

109
00:09:49,611 --> 00:09:58,219
That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate, and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him.

110
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:03,195
Taught not to me of blasphemy, man, I'd strike the sun if it insulted me.

111
00:10:04,277 --> 00:10:05,440
For could the sun do that?

112
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:13,094
Then could I do the other, Since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, Jealousy presiding over all creations.

113
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:17,743
But not my master, man, is even that fair play.

114
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:20,692
Who's over me, truth hath no confines.

115
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:26,119
Take off thine eye, more intolerable than fiend's glarings is adultish stare.

116
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:32,268
So, so, thou rednest and palest, my heat has melted thee to anger glow.

117
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:37,656
But look ye, starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself.

118
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:40,882
There are men from whom warm words are small in dignity.

119
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:42,645
I meant not to incense thee.

120
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:43,707
Let it go.

121
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:44,408
Look!

122
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:50,419
See yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn, living, breathing pictures painted by the sun.

123
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:59,475
The pagan leopards, the unwrecking and unworshipping things, that live and seek and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel.

124
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,718
The crew, man, the crew!

125
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:05,243
Are they not one and all With Ahab in this matter of the whale?

126
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,126
See Stubb, he laughs.

127
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:10,270
See yonder Chilean, He snorts to think of it.

128
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,137
Stand up amid the general hurricane, Thy one toast sapling cannot Starbuck.

129
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:16,118
And what is it?

130
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:16,839
Reckon it.

131
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,345
Tis but to help strike a fin, No wondrous feat for Starbuck.

132
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:22,167
What is it more?

133
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:30,886
From this one poor hunt, then, The best lance out of all Nantucket, Surely he will not hang back, When every foremast hand Has clutched a whetstone.

134
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:31,808
Ah!

135
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:40,667
constraining sees thee, I see, The billow lifts thee, speak, but speak, Ay, ay, thy silence, then, that voices thee.

136
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:45,939
I sidence, something shot from my dilated nostrils he has inhaled it in his lungs.

137
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:50,933
Starbuck now is mine, cannot oppose me now, without rebellion.

138
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:55,365
God keep me, keep us all, murmured Starbuck lowly.

139
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:14,105
But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation, nor yet the low laugh from the hold, nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds and the cordage, nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in.

140
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:19,733
For again Starbuck's downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life,

141
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:27,100
The subterranean laugh died away, the winds blew on, the sails filled out, the ship heaved and rolled as before.

142
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,104
Ah, ye admonitions and warnings, why stay ye not when ye come?

143
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,968
But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows.

144
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:41,953
Yet not so much predictions from without as verifications of the foregoing things within.

145
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:49,720
For with little external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these still drive us on.

146
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,422
"'The measure, the measure!'

147
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:52,403
cried Ahab.

148
00:12:53,084 --> 00:13:13,868
Receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered them to produce their weapons, then ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's company formed a circle round the group, he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew.

149
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:23,873
But those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison.

150
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:29,528
But, alas, only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.

151
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:30,704
Drink and pass!"

152
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:34,795
he cried, handing the heavy-charged flagon to the nearest seaman.

153
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:37,342
The crew alone now drink.

154
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:39,107
Round with it, round!

155
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:44,783
Short draughts, long swallows men, tis hot as Satan's hoof.

156
00:13:44,763 --> 00:13:45,524
So, so.

157
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,608
It goes round excellently.

158
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:49,350
It spiralizes in ye.

159
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:51,694
Forks out at the serpent's snapping eye.

160
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,776
Well done.

161
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:53,918
Almost drained.

162
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:55,160
That way it went.

163
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,422
This way it comes.

164
00:13:57,043 --> 00:13:57,584
Hand it me.

165
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:58,745
Here's a hollow.

166
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,829
Men, ye seen the years.

167
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,213
So brimming life is gulped and gone.

168
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:04,915
Steward, refill.

169
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:07,159
Attend now, my braves.

170
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:23,224
I have mustered ye all round this capstan, and ye mates, flank me with your lances, and ye harpooneers, stand there with your irons, and ye stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort revive a noble custom of my fishermen fathers before me.

171
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:24,867
O men, you will yet see that.

172
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:26,710
Ha, boy, come back.

173
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:28,753
Bad pennies come not sooner.

174
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:29,635
Hand it me.

175
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:30,877
Why now?

176
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:32,981
This pewter had run brimming again.

177
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,503
Wert not thou St.

178
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:36,527
Vitus's imp away, thou ague?

179
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,109
Advance, ye mates.

180
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,153
Cross your lances full before me.

181
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:40,954
Well done.

182
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:43,238
Let me touch the axis.

183
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:51,549
So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three-level radiating lances at their cross center, while so doing, suddenly and nervously twitched them.

184
00:14:52,070 --> 00:15:08,972
Meanwhile, glancing intently from starbuck to stub, from stub to flask, from stub to flask, it seemed as though, by some nameless interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life.

185
00:15:09,661 --> 00:15:13,847
The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect.

186
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:19,014
Stub and Flask looked sideways from him, the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.

187
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:32,192
In vain, cried Ahab, but maybe, tis well, all, for did ye three but once take the full force shock, then mine own electric thing, that had perhaps expired from out me.

188
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:34,975
Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead.

189
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:36,878
Perchance ye need it not.

190
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:40,023
Down lances, and now ye mates.

191
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:44,089
I do appoint ye three cup-bearers to my three pagan kinsmen there.

192
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,936
Yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers.

193
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:50,458
Disdain the task?

194
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:55,946
What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer?

195
00:15:56,907 --> 00:16:02,095
O my sweet cardinals, your own condescension, that shall bend ye to it.

196
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:04,178
I do not order ye, ye will it.

197
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:07,783
Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers.

198
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:19,020
Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs up, before him.

199
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:21,340
Stab me not with that keen steel.

200
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:23,703
Cant them, cant them over.

201
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:25,545
Know ye not the goblet end?

202
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:26,947
Turn up the socket.

203
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:30,711
So, so, now ye cup-bearers, advance.

204
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:33,555
The irons, take them, hold them while I fill."

205
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:41,464
Forthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.

206
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:43,527
Now, three to three ye stand.

207
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:45,509
Commend the murderous chalices.

208
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,655
Bestow them ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league.

209
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:50,616
Ha!

210
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:51,417
Starbuck!

211
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:52,979
But the deed is done.

212
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:56,063
Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it.

213
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:57,825
Drink, ye harpooneers.

214
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:02,051
Drink and swear, ye men, that man the deathful whaleboat's bow.

215
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:03,613
Death to Moby Dick!

216
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:07,458
God, hunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death.

217
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,962
The long barbed steel goblets were lifted.

218
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:17,062
And to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.

219
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:20,012
Starbuck paled and turned and shivered.

220
00:17:20,654 --> 00:17:21,115
Once more.

221
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:25,249
And finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew.

222
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:31,650
When, waving his free hand to them, they all dispersed, and Ahab retired within his cabin.
