CHAPTER XLIII Hark!

2
00:00:02,557 --> 00:00:05,804
Hissed Did you hear that noise, Cavaco?

3
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:08,570
It was the Middle Watch, a fair moonlight.

4
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:16,588
The seamen were standing in accordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist to the scuttlebutt near the tafrail.

5
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:20,827
In this manner they passed the buckets to fill the scuttlebutt.

6
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:30,579
Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarterdeck, they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:42,154
From hand to hand the buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.

8
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:52,370
It was in the midst of this repose that Archie, one of the Cordon, whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, "'Acholo!'

9
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:53,552
the words above.

10
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:54,694
"'Hist!

11
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,737
Did you hear that noise, Capico?

12
00:00:57,218 --> 00:00:58,880
Take the bucket, will ye, Archie?

13
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:00,563
What noise d'ye mean?'

14
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:02,666
"'There it is again under the hatches.

15
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:04,709
Don't you hear it aâ€”' "'Cough!

16
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,871
It sounded like a cough!'

17
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:08,195
"'Cough, be damned!

18
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:10,318
Pass along that return-bucket!'

19
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:12,290
There again!

20
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,392
There it is!

21
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:16,419
It sounds like two or three sleepers turning over.

22
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:17,100
Now!

23
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:20,067
Karamba have done, shipmate, will ye?

24
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:25,017
It's the three soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye nothing else.

25
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,440
Look to the bucket.

26
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,028
Say what ye will, shipmate.

27
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,430
Ay, then ye's.

28
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:39,782
Ay, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old Quakeress's knitting needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket.

29
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:41,024
You're the chap.

30
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:42,966
Grin away, well.

31
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:44,689
We'll see what turns up.

32
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:54,883
Hark ye, Capico, there is somebody down in the afterhold that has not yet been seen on deck, and I suspect our old mogul knows something of it too.

33
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,328
I heard Stub-tail flask, one morning watch,

34
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,747
that there was something of that sort in the wind.

35
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:02,198
Tish!

36
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:03,306
The bucket!
