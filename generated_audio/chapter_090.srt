Chapter 90 - Heads or Tails

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,349
Debalena verosificit, sirex habit caput, erigina cadam.

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,253
Bracton, L3, C3.

4
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:27,997
Latin from the books of the laws of England, which taken along with the context means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land, the king, as honorary grand harpoonier, must have the head, and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail.

5
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:32,704
A division which, in the whale, is much like having an apple,

6
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:34,446
there is no intermediate remainder.

7
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:57,898
Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in force in England, and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loose fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty,

8
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:07,777
In the first place, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years.

9
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:20,342
It seems that some honest mariners of Dover or Sandwich or some one of the Cinque Ports had, after a hard chase, succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally described as far off from the shore.

10
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:28,536
Now, the syncoports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a lord warden.

11
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:36,688
Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to the syncoport territories become by assignment his.

12
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:40,032
By some writers, this office is called a sinecure.

13
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:50,548
But not so, because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites, which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them.

14
00:01:51,153 --> 00:02:12,807
Now when these poor sunburnt mariners, barefooted and with their trousers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good L50 from the precious oil and bone, and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares,

15
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:22,801
upsteps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman with a copy of Blackstone under his arm, and laying it upon the whale's head, he says, Hands off!

16
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:26,026
This fish, my masters, is a fast fish.

17
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,409
I seize it as the Lord Warden's.

18
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:42,709
Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation, so truly English, knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round, meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger.

19
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:49,560
But that did in no wise mend the matter, or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with a copy of Blackstone.

20
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:54,827
At length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made bold to speak.

21
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:57,070
Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?

22
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,051
The Duke.

23
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:01,295
But the Duke had nothing to do with taking this fish.

24
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,156
It is his.

25
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:10,747
We have been at great trouble and peril and some expense, and is all that to go to the Duke's benefit, we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters.

26
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,409
It is his.

27
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,194
Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood?

28
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:18,496
It is his.

29
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:23,281
I thought to relieve my old bedridden mother by part of my share of this whale.

30
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:24,642
It is his.

31
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:27,746
Won't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?

32
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:28,867
It is his.

33
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:35,494
In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and His Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money.

34
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:55,356
Thinking that, viewed in some particular lights, the case might, by a bare possibility in some small degree, be deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to His Grace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration.

35
00:03:55,336 --> 00:04:11,742
To which my Lord Duke in substance replied, both letters were published, that he had already done so and received the money and would be obliged to the Reverend Gentleman if for the future he, the Reverend Gentleman, would decline meddling with other people's business.

36
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:19,032
Is this the still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?

37
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:25,801
It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign.

38
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:31,609
We must needs inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right.

39
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,793
The law itself has already been set forth.

40
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:37,979
But Plowden gives us the reason for it.

41
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:44,559
Says Plowden, the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen because of its superior excellence.

42
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:48,732
And by the soundest commentators this has ever been held.

43
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:50,911
A cogent argument in such matters.

44
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:54,776
But why should the king have the head, and the queen the tail?

45
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:57,199
A reason for that, ye lawyers.

46
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:10,276
In his treatise on Queen Gold, or Queen Pinmoney, an old King's Bench author, one William Prynne thus discourseth, Ye tail is ye queen's, that ye queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.

47
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:18,567
Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or right whale was largely used in ladies' bodices.

48
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:25,589
But this same bone is not in the tail, it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne.

49
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,033
But is the queen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail?

50
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:31,536
An allegorical meaning may lurk here.

51
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:43,929
There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers, the whale and the sturgeon, both royal property under certain limitations, and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's ordinary revenue.

52
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,473
I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter.

53
00:05:47,825 --> 00:06:04,030
But by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale, the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality.

54
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:08,162
And thus there seems a reason in all things, even in law.
