Chapter 15 - Chowder

3
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:12,128
It was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and Queequeg and I went ashore so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.

4
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:28,671
The landlord of the Spouter Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Tripots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best-kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders.

5
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:34,177
In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluck at the tri-pots.

6
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:51,958
But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then asked the first man we met where the place was, these crooked directions of his.

7
00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:05,931
very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse, our first point of departure, must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard.

8
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:15,743
However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.

9
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:25,337
Two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by ass's ears swung from the cross trees of an old topmast planted in front of an old doorway.

10
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:32,084
The horns of the cross trees were sawed off on the other side so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows.

11
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:39,132
Perhaps I was oversensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving.

12
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,397
A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns.

13
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:47,341
Yes, TW of them, one for Queequeg and one for me.

14
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:51,105
It's ominous, thinks I. A Coffin

15
00:01:52,115 --> 00:02:06,751
My innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port, tombstones staring at me in the whaleman's chapel, and here, a gallows, and a pair of prodigious black pots too, are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Toffit.

16
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:21,868
I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woolen shirt.

17
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:25,995
"'Get along with ye,' said she to the man, "'or I'll be combing ye.'

18
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:28,018
"'Come on, Queequeg,' said I.

19
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:29,601
"'All right, there's Mrs.

20
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:29,982
Hussey.'

21
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:38,676
And so it turned out, Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.

22
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:57,873
Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said, "'Clam or cod, what's that about cods, ma'am?'

23
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:00,377
said I with much politeness.

24
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:02,841
"'Clam or cod,' she repeated.

25
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:04,308
A clam for supper?

26
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,590
A cold clam?

27
00:03:06,031 --> 00:03:07,493
Is that what you mean, Mrs.

28
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:07,894
Hussey?"

29
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:13,282
says I. But that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the wintertime, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?

30
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:29,706
But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word, clam, Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out, clam for two, disappeared.

31
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:34,916
"'Queequeg,' said I, "'do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?'

32
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:42,531
However, a warm, savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us."

33
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:47,383
But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.

34
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:50,367
Oh, sweet friends, hearken to me.

35
00:03:50,387 --> 00:04:03,625
It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazelnuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flakes, the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.

36
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:23,908
Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favorite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we dispatched it with great expedition, when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.

37
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:29,075
Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word, code, with great emphasis, and resumed my seat.

38
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:37,645
In a few moments the savory steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod chowder was placed before us.

39
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:45,215
We resume business, and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head.

40
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:49,120
What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?

41
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,714
But look, Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl?

42
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:53,856
Where's your harpoon?

43
00:04:54,637 --> 00:05:01,667
Fishiest of all fishy places was the tri-pots, which well deserved its name, for the pots there were always boiling chowders.

44
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:09,758
Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish bones coming through your clothes.

45
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:12,441
The area before the house was paved with clamshells.

46
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:20,111
Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebrae, and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old sharkskin.

47
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:39,154
There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning, happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen's boats, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod's decapitated head, looking very slipshod, I assure ye.

48
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:40,036
Supper concluded.

49
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:44,585
We received a lamp and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed.

50
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:51,478
But, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon.

51
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,923
She allowed no harpoon in her chambers.

52
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:55,125
Why not?

53
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:58,492
said I. Every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon.

54
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:00,315
But why not?

55
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,537
Because it's dangerous, says she.

56
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:15,057
Ever since young Stiggs, coming from that unforten vegage of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of ILE, was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side.

57
00:06:15,638 --> 00:06:20,987
Ever since then I allow no boarders to take such dangerous weapons in their rooms at night.

58
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:27,840
So, Mr. Queequeg, for she had learned his name, I will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning.

59
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:31,767
But the chowder, clam, or cod tomorrow for breakfast, men.

60
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:36,917
Both, says I, and let's have a couple of smote herring by way of variety."
