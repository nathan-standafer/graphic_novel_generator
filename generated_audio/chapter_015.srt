CHAPTER XV.

2
00:00:01,693 --> 00:00:14,786
CHOWDER It was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor, and Crequig and I went ashore, so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.

3
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:27,979
The landlord of the Spouter Inn had recommended us to his cousin, Hosea Hussey, of the Tripots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best-kept hotels in all Nantucket.

4
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:34,752
And, moreover, he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders.

5
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:42,286
In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluck at the tripods.

6
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:49,579
But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard

7
00:00:49,559 --> 00:01:12,124
and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was cur these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Creekwag insisted that the yellow warehouse, our first point of departure, must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it

8
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:25,658
However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.

9
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:36,829
Two enormous wooden pots, painted black and suspended by ass's ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway.

10
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:44,940
The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.

11
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,609
Perhaps I was oversensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving.

12
00:01:53,410 --> 00:02:02,783
A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns—yes, to two of them, one for Queequeg and one for me.

13
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:05,466
It's ominous, thinks I.

14
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:11,677
A coffin by innkeeper, upon landing, in my first whaling-port tombstone, staring at me, in the whaleman's chapel.

15
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:13,360
And here are gallows.

16
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:16,426
And a pair of prodigious black pots, too.

17
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:20,974
Are these last throwing-out oblique hints touching Topheth?

18
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:40,587
I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woolen shirt.

19
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:45,055
"'Get along with ye,' said she to the men, or I'll be combing ye.

20
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:49,844
Come on, Queequeg," said I. All right, there's Mrs. Hussie.

21
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:59,019
And so it turned out, oh, say Hussie being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussie entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.

22
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,992
Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussie, postponing further scolding for the present,

23
00:03:06,972 --> 00:03:18,267
ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table, spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said, "'Clam or cod?'

24
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:20,089
"'What's that about cods, ma'am?'

25
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,091
said I, with much politeness.

26
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:24,034
"'Clam or cod?'

27
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:24,955
she repeated.

28
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:26,858
"'A clam for supper?'

29
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,480
"'A cold clam.

30
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,022
Is that what you mean, Mrs.

31
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:30,442
Hussey?'

32
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:31,043
says I.

33
00:03:31,063 --> 00:03:36,049
"'But that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the wintertime, ain't it, Mrs.

34
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,490
Hussey?'

35
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:53,500
But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word clam, Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out,

36
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,841
Clam for two."

37
00:03:55,963 --> 00:03:56,623
Disappeared.

38
00:03:56,663 --> 00:04:02,329
"'Queequeg,' said I, "'do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?'

39
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:10,197
However, a warm, savoury steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us.

40
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:15,723
But when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.

41
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:19,487
"'Oh, sweet friends,' hearkened to me.

42
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:34,050
It was made of small, juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazelnuts, mixed with pounded sheep biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes, the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.

43
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:48,997
Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and, in particular, Queequeg seeing his favorite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition.

44
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:58,550
When leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.

45
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:04,358
Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word cod, with great emphasis, and resumed my seat.

46
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:15,341
In a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavour, and in good time a fine cod chowder was placed before us.

47
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:23,891
We resumed business, and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head.

48
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:28,877
What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?

49
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:33,206
But look, Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl?

50
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:34,809
Where's your harpoon?

51
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:45,229
Fissiest of all fishy places was the Tri-Pots, which well deserved its name, for the pots there were always boiling chowders.

52
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:53,523
Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish bones coming through your clothes.

53
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:56,568
The area before the house was paved with clamshells.

54
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:01,176
Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebrae.

55
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:06,184
And Hosea Hussey had his account-books bound in superior old shark-skin.

56
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:26,117
There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning, happening to take a stroll along the beach, among some fishermen's boats, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand, with each foot in a cod's decapitated head.

57
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:29,062
Looking very slipshod, I assure ye."

58
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:30,825
Supper concluded.

59
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:48,477
We received a lamp and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed, but, as Queequeg was about to proceed near the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon—shayah, loud, no harpoon—in her chambers.

60
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:49,178
"'Why not?'

61
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:53,723
said I. Every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon, but why not?'

62
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:56,526
"'Because it's dangerous,' says she.

63
00:06:56,706 --> 00:07:11,283
Ever since young Stiggs, coming from that unfortun' vuge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of I.N., was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side.

64
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:17,890
Ever since then I allow no boarders to take such dangerous weepins in their rooms at night.'

65
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:25,334
So, Mr. Quickquake, for she had learned his name, I will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning.

66
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:30,109
But the chowder—clam or cod tomorrow for breakfast, men?"

67
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:36,469
"'Both,' says I, and let's have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety."
