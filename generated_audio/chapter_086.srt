00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:11,794
Chapter 86 - The Tail. Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights, lest celestial, I celebrate a tail.

2
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:19,288
Reckoning the largest-sized sperm whale's tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man,

3
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:24,194
It comprises upon its upper surface alone an area of at least 50 square feet.

4
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:33,967
The compact, round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness.

5
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:43,639
At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between.

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,691
In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the chrysanthic borders of these flukes.

7
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:56,403
At its utmost expansion in the full-grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.

8
00:00:57,285 --> 00:01:07,483
The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews, but cut into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose itâ€”upper, middle, and lower.

9
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:15,935
The fibers in the upper and lower layers are long and horizontal, those of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layers.

10
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:21,083
This triune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to the tail.

11
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:35,985
To the student of old Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contributes so much to the great strength of the masonry.

12
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:39,932
but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough.

13
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:54,058
The whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibers and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them and largely contribute to their might.

14
00:01:54,038 --> 00:02:03,917
So that in the tail the confluent, measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point, could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.

15
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:14,798
Nor does this, its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions, where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power.

16
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:19,005
On the contrary, those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it.

17
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:27,881
Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it, and in everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic.

18
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:36,077
Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone.

19
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:46,555
As devout Eckermann lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.

20
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:52,701
When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there.

21
00:02:53,262 --> 00:03:03,533
And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the sun, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most successfully embodied,

22
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:18,497
These pictures, so destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceited, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.

23
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,804
Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of,

24
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:31,267
that whether wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.

25
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,435
Therein no fairy's arm can transcend it.

26
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:38,245
Five great motions are peculiar to it.

27
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:40,488
First, when used as a fin for progression.

28
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:43,333
Second, when used as a mace in battle.

29
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:45,235
Third, in sweeping.

30
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:46,998
Fourth, in lobtailing.

31
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,021
Fifth, in peaking flukes.

32
00:03:49,782 --> 00:03:56,532
First, being horizontal in its position, the leviathan's tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.

33
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:57,914
It never wriggles.

34
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,520
In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.

35
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:05,886
To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.

36
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:15,220
Scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming.

37
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,444
His side fins only serve to steer by.

38
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:32,464
Second, it is a little significant that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.

39
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:38,703
In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.

40
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:46,161
If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply irresistible.

41
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:49,710
No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.

42
00:04:49,690 --> 00:05:07,753
Your only salvation lies in eluding it, but if it comes sideways through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most serious result.

43
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:14,362
These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery that they are accounted mere child's play.

44
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:17,706
Someone strips off a frock and the hole is stopped.

45
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:29,441
Third, I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail, for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equaled by the daintiness of the elephant's trunk.

46
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:45,820
This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea, and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor, whiskers and all.

47
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,346
What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!

48
00:05:48,948 --> 00:06:01,598
Had this tale any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of Darmanattas's elephant that so frequented the flower market, and with low salutations presented nose-gaze to damsels, and then caressed their zones.

49
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:13,795
On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail, for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.

50
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:27,855
Fourth, stealing, unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth,

51
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,259
But still you see his power in his play.

52
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:38,152
The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air, then smiting the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.

53
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:48,690
You would almost think a great gun had been discharged, and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was the smoke from the touch hole.

54
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:53,218
Fifth, as in the ordinary floating posture of the Leviathan,

55
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:56,420
The flukes lie considerably below the level of his back.

56
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,905
They are then completely out of sight beneath the surface.

57
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:16,310
But when he is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least 30 feet of his body are tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they downwards shoot out of view, accepting the sublime breach somewhere else to be described.

58
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:22,699
This peaking of the whale's flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature.

59
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:28,765
Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.

60
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:37,179
So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell.

61
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,566
But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in.

62
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,032
If in the Dantian, the devils will occur to you.

63
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:48,518
If in that of Isaiah, the archangels.

64
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:53,408
standing at the masthead of my ship during a sunrise that crimson sky and sea.

65
00:07:54,089 --> 00:08:01,241
I once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.

66
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:11,198
As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire-worshippers.

67
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:21,087
As Ptolemy Philopator testified of the African elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all beings.

68
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:29,976
For according to King Juba, the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence.

69
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:47,665
The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they respectively belong.

70
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:56,538
For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but the stalk of a lily.

71
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:15,981
The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls.

72
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:29,835
Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant,

73
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:34,307
Nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious similitude.

74
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:36,611
Among these is the spout.

75
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:44,305
It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it jet it forth in a stream.

76
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:50,777
The more I consider this mighty tale, the more do I deplore my inability to express it.

77
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:57,203
At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable.

78
00:09:57,943 --> 00:10:12,216
In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to Freemason signs and symbols, that the whale indeed by these methods intelligently conversed with the world.

79
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:20,764
Nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant.

80
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:24,088
Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep.

81
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:26,211
I know him not, and never will.

82
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,897
But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head?

83
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:35,323
Much more, how, comprehend his face when face he has none.

84
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:41,471
Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.

85
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:46,858
But I cannot completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face.

86
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:49,722
I say again, he has no face.
