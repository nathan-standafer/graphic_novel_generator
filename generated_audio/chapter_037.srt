00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:15,591
CHAPTER XXXVI THE QUARTER-DECK ENTER AHAB THEN ALL It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin gangway to the deck.

2
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:24,402
There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the garden.

3
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:39,403
Soon his steady ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all overdented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk.

4
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:51,809
Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow there also, you would see still stranger footprints, the footprints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.

5
00:00:51,989 --> 00:01:00,126
But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.

6
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:21,891
And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced, so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.

7
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:24,775
"'Thy mark and flask,' whispered Stubb.

8
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,158
"'The chick that's in him packs the shell.

9
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:29,320
It will soon be out.'

10
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:38,946
The hours wore on Ahab now shut up within his cabin, on pacing the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.

11
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,150
It drew near the close of day.

12
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:53,552
Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks, and, inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.

13
00:01:53,532 --> 00:02:01,064
"'Sir,' said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on shipboard except in some extraordinary case.

14
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:04,229
"'Send everybody aft,' repeated Ahab.

15
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,914
"'Mastheads, there, come down!'

16
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:14,005
When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces,

17
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:19,876
were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up.

18
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:34,963
Ahab, after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from his standpoint, and, as though not a soul were nigh him, resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.

19
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:51,433
With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wandering, whispering among the men, till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.

20
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:54,207
But this did not last long.

21
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,890
Vehemently pausing, he cried, cold.

22
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,834
What do ye do when ye see a whale-man sing out for him?

23
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:04,478
was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices.

24
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:14,650
Good, cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones, observing the hardy animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them.

25
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:17,032
And what do ye next, men?

26
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,256
Lower away, and after him.

27
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:22,600
And what tune is it ye pole to, men?

28
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:25,244
A dead whale or a stove-boat?"

29
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:44,775
Lorne, more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the countenance of the old men at every shout, while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.

30
00:03:44,755 --> 00:04:04,127
But they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus, quote, All ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white whale.

31
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:04,748
Look ye!

32
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:07,252
D. A. C. this Spanish ounce of gold?

33
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,898
Holding up a broad, bright coin to the sonnet,

34
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,701
Is a sixteen-dollar piece, men.

35
00:04:13,282 --> 00:04:13,963
D'ye see it?

36
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:17,127
Mr. Starbuck, hand me on Top Mall."

37
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:28,144
While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its luster.

38
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:42,977
And without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.

39
00:04:43,092 --> 00:05:13,032
Receiving the top maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast, with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a high-raised voice exclaiming, Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale, with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw, and whose woe of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starbur fluke-look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys.

40
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:13,633
"'Huzzah!

41
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:14,875
huzzah!'

42
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:21,045
cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.

43
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:27,054
"'It's a white whale, I say,' resumed Ahab, as he threw down the top malco, a white whale.

44
00:05:27,074 --> 00:05:28,556
"'Skin your eyes for him.

45
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,459
Men look sharp for white water.

46
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,484
If he see but a bubble, sing out!'

47
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:51,145
All this while Tash Tego, Dagoo, and Kwee Kweg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection.

48
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:57,953
"'Captain Ahab,' said Tash Tego, "'that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick.'"

49
00:05:58,726 --> 00:05:59,627
"'Moby Dick!'

50
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:00,809
shouted Ahab.

51
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,333
"'Do ye know the white whale, then, Tash?'

52
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:07,941
"'Does he fantail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?'

53
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:09,864
said the gay-header deliberately.

54
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:11,907
"'And has he a curious spout, too?'

55
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:18,878
said Dagu, very bushy, even for a Parmesete and mighty quick Captain Ahab.

56
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:37,812
and he have one, two, three, oh, good many iron in him hide, too, Captain," cried Quick-Weg disjointedly, all Twiskay T. B. Twisk, like him him faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle like him hath.

57
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:39,140
Cried Ayab.

58
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,662
Ay, kwee kweg!

59
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:43,706
The harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him.

60
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:45,168
Ay, dagoo!

61
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:52,919
His spout is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing.

62
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,802
Ay, tashdago!

63
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:58,006
And he fantails like a split jib in a squall.

64
00:06:58,247 --> 00:06:59,248
Death and devils!

65
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:01,191
Men, it is Moby Dick!

66
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:02,653
Ye hath seen Moby Dick!

67
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:03,394
Moby Dick!

68
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:24,336
Captain Ahab," said Starbuck, who, with stub and flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder, "'Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick, but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg.

69
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:25,457
"'Who told thee that?'

70
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,460
cried Ahab, then pausing.

71
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,845
"'Aye, store-buck, aye, my hearties, all round, aight.

72
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:38,312
Was Moby-Dick that dismasted me bout, Moby-Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now?'

73
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:44,700
"'Aye, aye,' he shouted with a terrific, loud animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose.

74
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,345
"'Aye, aye, it was that accursed white whale that raised me.

75
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:58,578
Made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day, Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations, He shouted out, I, I!

76
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:11,535
and I'll chase him round Good-hope and round the Horn, And round the Norway maelstrom, and round Perdition's flames before I give him up, And this is what ye have shipped for, man.

77
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:19,312
To chase that white whale on both sides of land, And over all sides of earth, Till he spouts black blood and rolls Finn out.

78
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:20,936
What say ye, men?

79
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:22,981
Will ye splice hands on it now?

80
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:24,985
I think ye do look brave."

81
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,185
I, I," shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the excited old man.

82
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:33,547
A sharp eye for the white whale!

83
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,869
A sharp lance for Moby Dick!

84
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,071
God bless ye!

85
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:40,413
he seemed to half-sob and half-shout.

86
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,295
God bless ye, men!

87
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:45,818
Steward, go draw the great measure of grog.

88
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:48,880
But what's this long face about, Mr. Starbuck?

89
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,443
Wilt thou not chase the white whale?

90
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:53,825
Art not game for Moby Dick?

91
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,187
I am game for his crooked jaw.

92
00:08:56,167 --> 00:09:02,661
And for the jaws of death, too, Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow.

93
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,572
But I came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance.

94
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:12,523
How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee, even if thou giddest it, Captain Ahab?

95
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,610
It will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.

96
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:17,847
Nantucket Market.

97
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:21,793
Hoot, but come closer, Starbuck.

98
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:23,836
Thou requirest a little lower layer.

99
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:38,037
If money's to be the measurer, Nan, and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch, then let me tell thee,

100
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:41,163
That my vengeance will fetch a great premium here."

101
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,968
"'Me smites his chest,' whispered Stubb.

102
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:44,970
"'What's that for?

103
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,235
Me thinks it rings most vast, but hollow.'"

104
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,181
"'Vengeance on a dumb brute!'

105
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:52,263
cried Starbuck.

106
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:55,388
"'That's simply smote thee from blindest instinct.

107
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:56,110
Madness!

108
00:09:56,691 --> 00:10:00,818
To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.'"

109
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:03,663
Hark ye yet again, the little lower layer!

110
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:13,399
All visible objects, man, are but his pasteboard masks, bought, in each event in, the living act, the undoubted dither.

111
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,111
Some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind, the unreasoning mask.

112
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:24,477
If man will strike, strike through the mask,

113
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,802
How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?

114
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:33,387
To me, the white whale is that wall shoved near to me.

115
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,090
Sometimes I think there's naught beyond.

116
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,611
But it's enough.

117
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:39,493
He tasks me, he heaps me.

118
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,056
I see in him outrageous strength.

119
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:44,859
With an inscrutable malice sinew in it.

120
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,602
That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate.

121
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:52,287
And be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal.

122
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:54,310
I will wreak that hate upon him.

123
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,453
Talk not to me of blasphemy, man.

124
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:59,016
I'd stripe the sun if it insulted me.

125
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:03,342
For could the sun do that, then could I do the other other sins.

126
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:08,990
There is ever a sort of fair play herein, Jealousy presiding over all creations.

127
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,474
But not my master, man, is even that fair play.

128
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,496
Who's over me?

129
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:15,118
Truth hath no confines.

130
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:16,520
Take off thine eye.

131
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,485
More intolerable than fiend's glarings is adultish stare.

132
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:25,655
So, so, so redness and palest my heat Has melted thee to anger glow.

133
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:31,385
But look ye, Starbuck, What is said in heat, the thing unsays itself.

134
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:34,411
There are men from whom warm words are small in dignity.

135
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:36,635
I meant not to incense thee.

136
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,338
Let it go.

137
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:52,902
Look, see under Turkish cheeks, Of spotted torn living, breathing pictures, Painted by the sun, the pagan leopards, The unwrecking and unworshipping things That live and seek and give no reasons For the torrid life they feel.

138
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:55,086
The crew, man, the crew!

139
00:11:55,106 --> 00:11:59,112
Are they not one and all with Ahab In this matter of the whale?

140
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:00,575
See, stub!

141
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:01,997
He laughs.

142
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:05,104
Sea yonder, Julian," he snorts to think of it.

143
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,649
Stand up amid the general hurricane.

144
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,533
Thy one-tossed dappling cannot.

145
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:10,796
Starbuck.

146
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:12,038
And what is it?

147
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,000
Reckon it.

148
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:15,225
Tis but to help strike a fin.

149
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:17,349
No wondrous feat for Starbuck.

150
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:19,113
What is it more from this?

151
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:20,376
One poor hunt, then.

152
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:22,821
The best lance out of all Nantucket.

153
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:27,548
Surely he will not hang back When every foremast hand Has clutched a whetstone.

154
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,673
Ah, constrainings, seize these, oop!

155
00:12:31,314 --> 00:12:32,896
Say, the billow lifts thee.

156
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:35,420
Speak, but speak.

157
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,303
Ay, ay, thy silence, then.

158
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:39,166
That voice is thee aside.

159
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:44,214
Something shot from my dilated nostrils, He has inhaled it in his lungs.

160
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:48,420
Starbuck now is mine, Cannot oppose me now without rebellion.

161
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,884
God, keep me, keep us all.

162
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:52,366
murmured Starbuck lowly.

163
00:12:52,887 --> 00:13:13,605
But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did not hear his foreboding indication, nor yet the low laugh from the hold, nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds and the cordage, nor is the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in.

164
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:19,150
For again Starbuck's downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life.

165
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:26,883
The subterranean laugh died away, the winds blew on the sails filled out, the ship heaved and rolled as before.

166
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:32,372
Ah, ye admonitions and warnings, why stay ye not when ye come?

167
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:40,667
But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows, yet not so much predictions from without as verifications of the full.

168
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:41,508
The measure!

169
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:43,872
cried Ahab.

170
00:13:43,852 --> 00:14:04,290
Receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harponeers, he ordered them to produce their weapons, then ranging them before him near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's company formed a circle round the group.

171
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,835
He took for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew.

172
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:24,391
But those wild eyes met his, as the blood-shot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison, but alas, only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.

173
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:30,497
Drink and pass, he cried, handing the heavy-charged flagon to the nearest seaman.

174
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:33,703
The crew alone now drink, round with it, round.

175
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:38,331
Short draughts, long swallows, man, tis hot as Satan's hoof.

176
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:41,778
So, so Sir Tenning's round excellently.

177
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,645
It spiralizes in ye, forks out at the serpent's snappet eye.

178
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:47,228
Well done, almost drained.

179
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:52,317
That way it wind, this way it comes, and it meteors a hollow.

180
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:57,486
Men, ye seem the years, So brooming life is gulped and gone, Steward, refill.

181
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:16,718
Attend now, my braves, I have mustard ye all round this capstan, And ye mates, flake me with your lances, And ye harpooneers, stand there with your irons, And ye stout mariners, ring me in, That I may in some sort revive a noble custom Of my fishermen fathers before me.

182
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:20,446
Oh, men, you will yet see that—boy, come back!

183
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:22,550
Bad pennies come not sooner.

184
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:23,653
Hand it me.

185
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:26,479
Why, now this pewter had run brimming again.

186
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,862
Wert not thou St.

187
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:29,425
Vitus in beway thou ague?

188
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:31,670
Advance, ye mates.

189
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:34,035
Cross your lances full before me.

190
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:34,937
Well done.

191
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:36,580
Let me touch the axis.

192
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:56,408
So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre, while so doing, suddenly and nervously twitched them, and while, glancing intently from starbook to stub, from stub to flask, it seemed as though by some nameless interior volition

193
00:15:57,097 --> 00:16:04,387
He would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the laden jar of his own magnetic life.

194
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:09,735
The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect.

195
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:15,122
Stub and flask looked sideways from him, the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.

196
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:16,726
"'In vain!'

197
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:19,694
cried Ahab, but maybe tis well.

198
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:30,985
For did ye three but once take the full force shock, then my known electric thing, that had perhaps expired from out me, perchance too it would have dropped ye dead.'

199
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:32,868
Perchance ye need it not.

200
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:44,924
Down, lances, and now, ye mates, I do appoint ye three cup-bearers, To my three pagan kinsmen thereyon, Three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, My valiant harpooneers.

201
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:51,673
Disdain the task— What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars Using his tiara for ewer?

202
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:53,355
Oh, my sweet cardinals!

203
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,118
Your own condescension!

204
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:57,080
That shall bend you to it.

205
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,245
I do not order ye to you, will it?

206
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:03,750
Cut your ceasings and draw the poles, you harpooneers.

207
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:13,603
Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barged up before him.

208
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,048
Stab me not with that keen steel.

209
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:18,690
Cant them over.

210
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:20,833
Know ye not the goblet end?

211
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:22,297
Turn up the socket.

212
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:25,682
So, so now, ye cun-bearers, advance.

213
00:17:26,183 --> 00:17:28,467
The irons, take them, hold them, while I fill."

214
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:36,279
Forthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon-sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.

215
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,424
Now, three to three, ye stand.

216
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,648
Commend the murderous chalices.

217
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:46,315
Bestow them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league.

218
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:50,056
Ah, Starbuck, but the deed is done.

219
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:53,262
Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it.

220
00:17:53,903 --> 00:18:00,213
Drink, ye harpooniers, drink and swear, Ye men that mend the deathful whale-boats bow death to Moby Dick.

221
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:04,540
God hunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death.

222
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:15,041
The long barbed steel goblets were lifted, and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.

223
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:18,789
Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered.

224
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:24,160
Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew.

225
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:31,354
When, waving his free hand to them, they all dispersed, and Ahab retired within his cabin.
