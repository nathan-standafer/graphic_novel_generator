Chapter 37 - Sunset

3
00:00:03,496 --> 00:00:07,682
The cabin by the stern windows, Ahab sitting alone and gazing out.

4
00:00:08,483 --> 00:00:13,250
I leave a white and turbid wake, pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:19,379
The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track, let them, but first I pass.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,347
Yonder, by ever brimming goblets rim, the warm waves blush like wine.

7
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:27,072
The gold brow plums the blue.

8
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:32,146
The diver's son, slow-dived from noon, goes down, my soul mounts up.

9
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:34,392
She wearies with her endless hill.

10
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:37,701
Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear?

11
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:40,669
This iron crown of Lombardy.

12
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:49,617
Yet is it bright with many a gem, I, the wearer, see not its far flashings, But darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds.

13
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:55,782
Tis iron, that I know, not gold, tis split, too, that I feel.

14
00:00:56,143 --> 00:01:00,747
The jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal.

15
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:06,352
I, steel skull, mine, the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight.

16
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:09,154
Dry heat upon my brow,

17
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:14,561
Oh, time was when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed.

18
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:15,522
No more.

19
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,345
This lovely light, it lights not me.

20
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,989
All loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er enjoy.

21
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,655
Gifted with a high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power.

22
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:29,719
Damned, most subtly and most malignantly.

23
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:31,741
Damned in the midst of paradise.

24
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:34,645
Good night, good night, good night.

25
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:39,090
Waving his hand, he moves from the window.

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,593
twas not so hard a task.

27
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:49,010
I thought to find one stubborn, at the least, but my one-cod circle fits into all their various wheels, and they revolve.

28
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:55,543
Or, if you will, like so many anthills of powder, they all stand before me and I their match.

29
00:01:55,523 --> 00:02:00,190
Oh, hard, that to fire others, the match itself must needs be wasting.

30
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:03,415
What I've dared, I've willed, and what I've willed, I'll do.

31
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,998
They think me mad.

32
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:07,221
Starbuck does, but I'm demoniac.

33
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:12,289
I am madness maddened, that wild madness that's only calm to comprehend itself.

34
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,557
The prophecy was that I should be dismembered, and I, I lost this leg.

35
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:20,982
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer.

36
00:02:21,023 --> 00:02:23,927
Now then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one.

37
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:26,873
That's more than ye, ye great gods, ever were.

38
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:33,382
I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf-burkies, and blinded-bindigos.

39
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:39,090
I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies, Take some one of your own size, don't pommel me.

40
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:46,320
No, ye've knocked me down, and I am up again, But why, ye have run and hidden, but why, ye have run and hidden.

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,525
Come forth from behind your cotton bags.

42
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:50,691
I have no long gun to reach ye.

43
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,217
Come Ahab's compliments to ye.

44
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:55,302
Come and see if ye can swerve me.

45
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:56,645
Swerve me?

46
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:59,672
Ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves.

47
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,356
Man has ye there.

48
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:08,052
Swerve me, the path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.

49
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:14,743
Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under torrents' beds, unerringly I rush.

50
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,990
Knot's an obstacle, knot's an angle to the iron way.
