00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:08,351
Chapter 28 - Ahab. For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab.

2
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:12,100
The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches.

3
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:26,004
and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship, only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously.

4
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:36,619
Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.

5
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:44,421
Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible.

6
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:52,749
For my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea, became almost a perturbation.

7
00:00:53,349 --> 00:01:04,260
This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of.

8
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,330
But poorly could I withstand them.

9
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:13,862
Much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.

10
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:25,829
but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness, to call it so, which I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all warranty to cherish such emotions.

11
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:38,550
For though the Harponiers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with,

12
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:48,979
Still I ascribe this, and rightly ascribed it, to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked.

13
00:01:49,178 --> 00:02:02,658
but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colorless misgivings and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.

14
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:15,777
Three better, more likely sea officers and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of themâ€”Americans, a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder,

15
00:02:15,757 --> 00:02:20,747
a cape man, now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor.

16
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:36,297
For a space we had biting polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the southward, and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter and all its intolerable weather behind us.

17
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:57,964
It was one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I leveled my glance towards the taff rail, foreboding shivers ran over me.

18
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,907
Reality outran apprehension.

19
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,510
Captain Ahab stood upon his quarterdeck.

20
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:08,077
There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the recovery from any.

21
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:19,632
He looked like a man cut away from the stake when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness.

22
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:29,085
His whole high, broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mold like Cellini's cast Perseus.

23
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:42,183
Threading its way out from among his gray hairs and continuing right down one side of his tawny, scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender, rod-like mark, lividly whitish.

24
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:48,471
It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree.

25
00:03:48,451 --> 00:04:00,667
When the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, you're running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.

26
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:08,417
Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say.

27
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:14,449
by some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates.

28
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:25,191
But once Tashtego's senior, an old gay-head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded,

29
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:30,881
and then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea.

30
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:46,268
Yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never e'er this laid eye upon wild Ahab.

31
00:04:46,248 --> 00:05:02,788
Nevertheless, the old sea traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment, so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that, if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out,

32
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,571
which might hardly come to pass, so he muttered.

33
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:12,398
Then, whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birthmark on him from crown to soul.

34
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:27,713
So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.

35
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:34,427
It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had its sieve in fashion from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw.

36
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:39,397
Aye, he was dismasted off Japan, said the old gay-head Indian once.

37
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:44,427
But like his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for it.

38
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,090
He has a quiver of them.

39
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:49,256
I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.

40
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:58,632
Upon each side of the Pequod's quarterdeck and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so into the plank.

41
00:05:59,232 --> 00:06:09,529
His bone leg steadied in that hole, one arm elevated and holding by a shroud, Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.

42
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:18,005
There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable willfulness, in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance.

43
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:31,129
Not a word he spoke, nor did his officers say ought to him, though by all their minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master eye.

44
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:40,766
And not only that, but moody, stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face, in all the nameless, regal, overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.

45
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:46,519
Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.

46
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:56,015
But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew, either standing in his pivot hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had, or heavily walking the deck.

47
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:10,920
As the sky grew less gloomy, indeed began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse, as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.

48
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,312
And, by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air.

49
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:26,715
But, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.

50
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:43,000
But the Pequod was only making a passage now, not regularly cruising, nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite Ahab now and thus chase away.

51
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:51,552
For that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.

52
00:07:51,592 --> 00:08:01,647
Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from his mood.

53
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:16,717
For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods, even the barest, ruggedest, most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants.

54
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:21,987
So Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air.

55
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:30,283
More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.
