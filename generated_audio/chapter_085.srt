00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:08,944
Chapter 85 - The Fountain. that for 6,000 years and no one knows how many millions of ages before.

2
00:00:09,346 --> 00:00:19,907
The great whale should have been spouting all over the sea and sprinkling and mystifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many sprinkling or mystifying pots, and that for some centuries back.

3
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:25,679
Thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,308
That all this should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute.

5
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:34,021
Fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o'clock p.m.

6
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:43,169
of this sixteenth day of December, A.D., 1851, it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings are, after all, really spouting.

7
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:47,533
Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items contingent.

8
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:58,303
Everyone knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, the Finney tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim.

9
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:04,092
Hence, a herring or a cod might live a century and never once raise its head above the surface.

10
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:18,250
But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere, wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world.

11
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:27,822
But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for in his ordinary attitude, the sperm whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface.

12
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:32,090
And what is still more, his windpipe has no connection with his mouth.

13
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:38,162
No, he breathes through his spiracle alone, and this is on the top of his head.

14
00:01:38,142 --> 00:01:59,728
If I say that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element, which, being subsequently brought into contact with the blood, imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err, though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.

15
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:10,798
Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.

16
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:13,858
That is to say, he would then live without breathing.

17
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:30,829
Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more when at the bottom, without drawing a single breath or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air, for, remember, he has no gills.

18
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:32,395
How is this?

19
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:45,414
Between his ribs and on each side of his spine, he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood.

20
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:59,415
So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs.

21
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:15,733
The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable, and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutans out, as the fishermen phrase it.

22
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:16,815
This is what I mean.

23
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:26,294
If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings.

24
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:33,469
Say he stays 11 minutes and jets 70 times, that is, respires 70 breaths.

25
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:38,379
Then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his 70 breaths over again, to a minute.

26
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:47,297
Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air.

27
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:53,770
And not till those 70 breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below.

28
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,660
Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are different, but in any one they are alike.

29
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:08,976
Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, air descending for good?

30
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:17,310
How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase.

31
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:23,869
For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight.

32
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,516
Not so much thy skill then, O hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee.

33
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:44,175
In man breathing is incessantly going on, one breath only serving for two or three pulsations, so that whatever other business he has to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must or die he will.

34
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:48,481
But the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time.

35
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:52,226
It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout hole.

36
00:04:53,087 --> 00:05:01,478
If it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him.

37
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:06,624
For the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout hole.

38
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:12,492
And being so clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling.

39
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,991
but owing to the mystery of the spout.

40
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:21,941
Whether it be water or whether it be vapor, no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head.

41
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:26,407
Sure it is, nevertheless, that the sperm whale has no proper olfactories.

42
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:28,090
But what does he want of them?

43
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,735
No roses, no violets, no cologne water in the sea.

44
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:36,842
Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal,

45
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:53,665
And as that long canal, like the Grand Erie Canal, is furnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice, unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he talks through his nose.

46
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,629
But then again, what has the whale to say?

47
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:05,361
Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living.

48
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:08,837
Oh, happy that the world is such an excellent listener.

49
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:22,790
Now, the spouting canal of the sperm whale, chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side.

50
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:29,075
This curious canal is very much like a gas pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street.

51
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:34,200
But the question returns whether this gas pipe is also a water pipe.

52
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:45,052
In other words, whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle.

53
00:06:45,092 --> 00:07:02,010
It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal, but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle, because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.

54
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:07,303
But the sperm whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would.

55
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:19,746
Besides, if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.

56
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:23,494
But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?

57
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:24,617
Speak out!

58
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:27,984
You have seen him spout, then declare what the spout is.

59
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:30,169
Can you not tell water from air?

60
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,300
My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things.

61
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:39,169
I have ever found your plain things the naughtiest of all.

62
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:45,837
And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.

63
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:50,582
The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it.

64
00:07:51,183 --> 00:08:03,537
And how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him.

65
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:12,432
And if at such times you should think that you really perceive drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor?

66
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:21,087
Or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout hole fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whale's head?

67
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:40,662
for even when tranquilly swimming through the midday sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert, even then, the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.

68
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:46,661
Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over-curious touching the precise nature of the whale-spout.

69
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:51,107
It will not do for him to be peering into it and putting his face in it.

70
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:55,614
You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away.

71
00:08:55,654 --> 00:09:02,363
For even when coming into slight contact with the outer vapoury shreds of the jet, which will often happen,

72
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:07,152
your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing so touching it.

73
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:18,555
And I know one, who, coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.

74
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:23,845
Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous, they try to evade it.

75
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:31,470
Another thing, I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.

76
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:38,087
The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout alone.

77
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:42,775
Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish.

78
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:47,180
My hypothesis is this, that the spout is nothing but mist.

79
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:51,384
And besides other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled.

80
00:09:51,945 --> 00:10:07,821
By considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale, I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are.

81
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:25,877
He is both ponderous and profound, and I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam while in the act of thinking deep thoughts.

82
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:38,922
While composing a little treatise on eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me, and earlong saw reflected there a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head.

83
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:50,714
invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin-shingled attic of an August noon, this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.

84
00:10:51,375 --> 00:11:03,036
And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea, his vast, mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor.

85
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:14,212
engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that vapor, as you will sometimes see it, glorified by a rainbow, as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.

86
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:29,614
For, Dicey, rainbows do not visit the clear air, they only irradiate vapor, and so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.

87
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:38,311
And for this I thank God, for all have doubts many deny, but doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions.

88
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:42,904
Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly.

89
00:11:43,606 --> 00:11:50,083
This combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.
