Chapter 6 - The Street

2
00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:17,753
If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.

3
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:25,882
In thoroughfares, nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest-looking nondescripts from foreign parts.

4
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:32,569
Even in Broadway and chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.

5
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:40,446
Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays, and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives.

6
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:43,889
But New Bedford beats all Water Street in whopping.

7
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:56,001
In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors, but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners, savages outright, many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh.

8
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:58,624
It makes a stranger stare.

9
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:15,533
But, besides the Phygians, Tongotobors, Eremongoans, Panangeans, and Brygians, and besides the wild specimens of the whaling craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious, certainly more comical.

10
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:23,046
There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all a thirst for gain and glory in the fishery.

11
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:31,660
They are mostly young, of stalwart frames, fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance.

12
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:35,226
Many are as green as the green mountains whence they came.

13
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,073
In some things you would think them but a few hours old.

14
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:41,808
Look there, that chap strutting round the corner.

15
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:47,034
He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed coat girdled with a sailor belt and sheath knife.

16
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:50,558
Here comes another with a Sue Wester and a bombazine cloak.

17
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:54,342
No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one.

18
00:01:55,143 --> 00:02:04,453
I mean a downright bumpkin dandy, a fellow that, in the dog days, will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.

19
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:15,623
Now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the great whale fishery, you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport.

20
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:21,992
In bespeaking his sea outfit, he orders bell buttons to his waistcoats, straps to his canvas trousers.

21
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:32,888
Ah, poor hayseed, how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale when thou art driven, straps, buttons and all, down the throat of the tempest.

22
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:38,958
But think not that this famous town has only harponeers, cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors.

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,120
Not at all.

24
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:42,846
Still New Bedford is a queer place.

25
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:50,640
Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador.

26
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:54,316
As it is, parts of her backcountry are enough to frighten one.

27
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:55,537
They look so bony.

28
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:59,562
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England.

29
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:05,848
It is a land of oil, true enough, but not like Canaan, a land, also, of corn and wine.

30
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:10,934
The streets do not run with milk, nor in the springtime do they pave them with fresh eggs.

31
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:20,644
Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses, parks, and gardens more opulent than in New Bedford.

32
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,503
Whence came they?

33
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,308
How planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?

34
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,537
Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be answered.

35
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:39,506
Yes, all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.

36
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:45,433
One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea.

37
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:48,039
Can Hare Alexander perform a feat like that?

38
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:55,833
In New Bedford fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apiece.

39
00:03:56,454 --> 00:04:07,253
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding, for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their links in spermaceti candles.

40
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:13,040
In summertime the town is sweet to see, full of fine maples, long avenues of green and gold.

41
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:23,434
And in August, high in air, the beautiful and bountiful horse, chestnuts candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms.

42
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:35,569
So omnipotent is art, which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation's final day.

43
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:39,073
And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.

44
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:46,542
But roses only bloom in summer, whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.

45
00:04:47,163 --> 00:05:02,502
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles offshore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.
