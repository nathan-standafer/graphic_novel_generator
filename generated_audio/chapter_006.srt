CHAPTER VI.

2
00:00:01,092 --> 00:00:19,536
THE STREET If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.

3
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:29,970
In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest-looking nondescripts from foreign parts.

4
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:37,026
Even in Broadway and Chestnut Streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.

5
00:00:37,707 --> 00:00:47,048
Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malaise, and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, Lionkees have often scared the natives.

6
00:00:47,028 --> 00:00:50,674
but New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping.

7
00:00:50,815 --> 00:01:03,436
In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors, but in New Bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners, savages outright, many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh.

8
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:11,871
It piques a stranger's stare, but besides the Fijians, Tanganyburs, Aramanguans, Kanangians,

9
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:23,386
and Bridgians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious, certainly more comical.

10
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:33,319
There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all a thirst for gain and glory in the fishery.

11
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:42,094
They are mostly young, of stalwart frames, fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lads.

12
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:45,637
Many are as green as the green mountains whence they came.

13
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:49,582
In some things you would think them but a few hours old.

14
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,446
Look there, that chap strutting round the corner.

15
00:01:54,187 --> 00:02:00,294
He wears a beaver-hat and swallow-tailed coat girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.

16
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:05,881
Here comes another with a Sue Wester and a Bombazine cloak.

17
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:09,685
No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred Y.I.

18
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:19,343
Mean a downright bumpkin dandier fellow, That in the dog-days will mow his two acres In buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.

19
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:28,804
Now when a country dandy like this Takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation, And joins the great whale-fishery,

20
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:33,489
You should see the comical things he does upon reaching the sea-port.

21
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:39,836
In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats, straps to his canvas trousers.

22
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:51,990
Ah, poor hay-seed, how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest!

23
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:58,202
But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors.

24
00:02:58,904 --> 00:02:59,465
Not at all.

25
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:02,451
Still, New Bedford is a queer place.

26
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:12,831
Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador.

27
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:16,877
As it is, parts of her bad country are enough to frighten one.

28
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:18,459
They look so bony.

29
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,624
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England.

30
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:30,275
It is a land of oil, true enough for, but not like Canaan, ah, land, also of corn and wine.

31
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:36,203
The streets do not run with milk, nor in the springtime do they pave them with fresh eggs.

32
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:46,012
Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America Will you find more patrician-like houses, parks, and gardens More opulent than in New Bedford.

33
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:47,553
Whence came they?

34
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:51,537
How planted Upon this once scruggy scoria of a country?

35
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:58,903
Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons Round yonder lofty mansion, and your question Will be answered.

36
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:06,190
Yes, all these brave houses and flowery gardens Came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.

37
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,961
One and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea.

38
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:15,328
Can't hear Alexander perform a feat like that.

39
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:21,580
In New Bedford fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters.

40
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,186
and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apiece.

41
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:37,746
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding, for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their links in spermaceti candles.

42
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:56,173
In summertime the town is sweet to see, Full of fine maples, long avenues of green and gold, And in August, high in air, the beautiful and bountiful Horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, Proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones Of congregated blossoms.

43
00:04:56,153 --> 00:05:08,029
So omnipotent is art, which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation's final day.

44
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,555
And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.

45
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:21,688
But roses only bloom in summer, whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.

46
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:24,177
elsewhere match that bloom of theirs.

47
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:30,340
Ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk.

48
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:40,437
Their sailor sweethearts smell the miles offshore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.
