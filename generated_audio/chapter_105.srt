Chapter 1005 - Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish? Will He Perish?

4
00:00:06,163 --> 00:00:19,989
Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the headwaters of the eternities, it may be fitly inquired whether, in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,714
But upon investigation we find,

6
00:00:22,694 --> 00:00:42,576
that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system, embracing a distinct geological period prior to man, but of the whales found in that tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones.

7
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:51,911
Of all the pre-Adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than 70 feet in length in the skeleton.

8
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:59,603
Whereas, we have already seen that the tape measure gives 72 feet for the skeleton of a large-sized modern whale.

9
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:05,889
And I have heard, on whalemen's authority, that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.

10
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:17,740
But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are in advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods, may it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?

11
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:26,468
Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny and the ancient naturalists generally.

12
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:34,584
For Pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which measured 800 feet in length.

13
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:37,807
Rope walks in Thames tunnels of whales.

14
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:56,607
And even in the days of Banks and Salander, Cook's naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland whales, Raedon sisgur, or wrinkled bellies at 120 yards, that is 320 yards, that is 360 feet,

15
00:01:56,587 --> 00:02:08,451
And Lésipède, the French naturalist, in his Elaborate History of Whales, in the very beginning of his work, page 3, sets down the right whale at 100 meters, 328 feet.

16
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:11,858
And this work was published so late as A.D.

17
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,802
1825.

18
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:16,288
But will any whaleman believe these stories?

19
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:17,009
No.

20
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:21,299
The whale of today is as big as his ancestors in Pliny's time.

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,315
And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman more than he was, will make bold to tell him so.

22
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:58,369
Because I cannot understand how it is that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks, and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh's fat kind.

23
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:09,732
In the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated, but still another inquiry remains, one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers.

24
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:15,042
Whether owing to the almost omniscient lookouts at the mast-heads of the whale-ships,

25
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:26,145
now penetrating even through Bering Straits and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world, and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts.

26
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:34,161
The moot point is whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc.

27
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:44,834
whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.

28
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:54,546
Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands,

29
00:03:55,066 --> 00:04:07,284
the prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sights of populous river capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch.

30
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:15,777
In such a comparison, an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.

31
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:23,368
But you must look at this matter in every light, though so short a period ago, not a good lifetime.

32
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:42,434
The census of the Buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region, and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man, yet the far different nature of the whale hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan.

33
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:52,748
Forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish.

34
00:04:52,728 --> 00:05:15,609
Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when the Far West, in whose sunset suns still rise, was a wilderness and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not 40, but 40,000 and more buffaloes, a fact that, if need were, could be statistically stated.

35
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:22,735
Nor, considered a right, does it seem any argument in favor of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale, for example.

36
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:37,146
that in former years, the latter part of the last century, say, these leviathans, in small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative.

37
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:43,339
Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some views to safety,

38
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:55,312
now swim the seas in immense caravans, so that, to a large degree, the scattered solitaries, yokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.

39
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:56,713
That is all.

40
00:05:57,434 --> 00:06:09,006
And equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them, hence that species also is declining.

41
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:21,891
For they are only being driven from promontory to cape, and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.

42
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:32,344
Furthermore, concerning these last-mentioned leviathans, they have two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will forever remain impregnable.

43
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:37,329
And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains.

44
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:58,230
So, hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whalebone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and flows, and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.

45
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:10,008
But as perhaps 50 of these whalebone whales are harpooned for one cashalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.

46
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:26,833
But though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000, have been annually slain on the norwest coast by the Americans alone, yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter.

47
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:33,184
natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe.

48
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:48,028
Yet what shall we say to Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting, the king of Siam took 4,000 elephants, that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes?

49
00:07:48,008 --> 00:08:16,699
And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of years by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the East, if they still survive there in great numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas, Europe, and Africa, New Holland, and all the isles of the sea combined.

50
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:25,163
Moreover, we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of whales, they're probably attaining the age of a century and more.

51
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:32,022
Therefore, at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations must be contemporary.

52
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:50,025
And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by imagining all the graveyards, cemeteries, and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago, and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe.

53
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:58,195
Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his species, however perishable in his individuality.

54
00:08:58,175 --> 00:09:00,960
He swam the seas before the continents broke water.

55
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:05,688
He once swam over the site of the Tuileries and Windsor Castle and the Kremlin.

56
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:23,440
In Noah's flood he despised Noah's Ark, and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the Netherlands to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.
