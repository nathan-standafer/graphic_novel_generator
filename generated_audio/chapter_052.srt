00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:21,634
Chapter 51 THE SPIRIT SPOUT Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising grounds, that off the Azores, off the Cape de Verdes, on the Plate so-called, being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, and the Carol Ground, an unstaked watery locality,

2
00:00:21,614 --> 00:00:22,996
southerly from St.

3
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:23,476
Helena.

4
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:46,744
It was while gliding through these latter waters, that one serene and moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver, and by their soft suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude, not a solitude, not a silent night, a silvery jit was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow.

5
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:53,654
Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial, seeing some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea.

6
00:00:54,115 --> 00:01:06,713
Fadala first described this chan- For of these moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand and look out there, with the same precision, as if it had been day.

7
00:01:06,754 --> 00:01:15,246
And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture alluring for them.

8
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:41,638
You may think with what emotions, then, the seaman beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours, his turban and the moon, companions in one sky, but when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights, without uttering a single sound, when after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moonlit jet,

9
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:50,223
Every reclining mariner started to his feet, as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.

10
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,186
There she blows!

11
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:56,352
Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more.

12
00:01:56,793 --> 00:02:03,542
Yet still they felt no terror or rather pleasure, for though it was a most unwanted hour,

13
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:12,194
Yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering.

14
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:21,787
Walking the deck with quick side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the tuggalant sails and royals to be set, and every stunned sail spread.

15
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:25,092
The best man in the ship must take the helm.

16
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:31,200
Then, with every mast head manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wing.

17
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:42,416
The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the taff-rail breeze, filling the hollows of so many sails, made the buoyed, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet.

18
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:51,248
While still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her one to mount direct to heaven.

19
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:54,835
the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal.

20
00:02:55,135 --> 00:03:01,528
And had you watched Ahab's face that night, you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring.

21
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:09,784
While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limbs sounded like a coffin tap.

22
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:14,232
On life and death this old man walked.

23
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:25,022
Well, but though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night.

24
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:29,706
Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.

25
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:35,771
This midnight spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days after, lo!

26
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:39,254
at the same silent hour, it was again announced.

27
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:42,177
Ginnett was described by all!

28
00:03:42,157 --> 00:04:03,422
but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it disappeared as if it had never been, and so it served us night after night, till no one heeded it but to wander at it, mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight, as the case might be disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three.

29
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:20,922
And, somehow seeming, at every distinct repetition, to be advancing still further and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on, nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with the preternaturalness, as it seemed,

30
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:42,133
which in many things invested the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever described, at however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one's selfsame whale, and that whale, Moby Dick.

31
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:59,856
For a time there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas.

32
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:11,952
These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath all its blue blandness,

33
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:29,805
Some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prowl, butâ€”

34
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:50,493
At last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are there, when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the foam flakes flew over her bulwarks.

35
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:58,324
Then all this desolate vacuity of life went away, but Dave placed his sights more dismal than before.

36
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:04,192
Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us.

37
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:26,100
While thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens, and every morning perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen in spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft, our thing appointed to desolation.

38
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,687
And therefore a fit roosting-place for their homeless selves.

39
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:44,899
And he did heave still and restingly heave the Black Sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience, and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse, for the long sin and suffering it had bred.

40
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,221
Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye?

41
00:06:47,442 --> 00:07:11,545
Rather Cape Tormentoto, as called of yore, for longer lured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon.

42
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:23,719
But calm, snow-white, and unvarying, still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky, still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be described.

43
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:33,550
During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,

44
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:39,739
manifested the gloomiest reserve, and, more seldom than ever, addressed his mates.

45
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:49,713
In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale.

46
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,718
Then captain and crew become practical fatalists.

47
00:07:54,299 --> 00:08:01,309
So, with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud,

48
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:12,588
Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together.

49
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:23,787
Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks and the waste,

50
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:35,143
And, the better to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a sort of bow-line secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt.

51
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:53,850
Few or no words were spoken, and the silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on, through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves, by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed.

52
00:08:54,431 --> 00:09:00,962
Still in silence the men swung in the bow-lines, still wordless, Ahab stood up to the blast.

53
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:08,122
Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose, he would not seek that repose in his hammock.

54
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:31,810
Never could Starbuck forget the old man's aspect, when one night, going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him, with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair, the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had, some time before, emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat.

55
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:39,886
On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of.

56
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:44,094
His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand.

57
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:52,971
Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back, so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale.

58
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:57,598
that swung from a beam in the ceiling, shin, zappÃ©, and raft.

59
00:09:58,219 --> 00:10:07,575
We called the cabin compass as called the Telltale, because without going to the compass at the helm, the captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the ship.

60
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:08,796
Terrible old man!"

61
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:10,619
thought Starbuck with a shudder.

62
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:15,988
Sleeping in this gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose
