Chapter 56 OF THE LESS IRONIOUS PICTURES OF WALES, AND THE TRUE PICTURES OF WALING SCENES In connection with the monstrous pictures of Wales, I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them, which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny, Purchase, Herculet, Harris, Cuvier, &c. But I pass that matter by.

2
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:36,515
I know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale, Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's.

3
00:00:37,377 --> 00:00:40,622
In the previous chapter, Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to.

4
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:47,132
Huggins's is far better than theirs, but by great odds, Beale's is the best.

5
00:00:47,112 --> 00:00:57,163
All Beale's drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter.

6
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:09,998
His frontispiece, Boats Attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated to excite the civil skepticism of some paller men, is admirably correct and lifelike in its general effect.

7
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,346
Some of the sperm whale drawings in J. Ross Brown are pretty correct in contour, but they are wretchedly engraved.

8
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:18,649
That is not his fault, though.

9
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:29,421
So, of the right whale, the best outlined pictures are in Scoresby, but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression.

10
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:39,732
He has but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because it is by such pictures only, when at all well done,

11
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:46,146
that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale, as seen by his living hunters.

12
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:57,552
But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found.

13
00:01:57,532 --> 00:02:03,861
are two large French engravings, well executed and taken from paintings by one garnery.

14
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:09,008
Respectively, they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale.

15
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:18,882
In the first engraving, a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean.

16
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:24,610
and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the Stoven Planks.

17
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:32,361
The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster's spine, and standing in that prow.

18
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:46,120
For that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping as if from a precipice.

19
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,822
The action of the whole thing,

20
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:50,306
is wonderfully good and true.

21
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:53,953
The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea.

22
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:58,881
The wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it.

23
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:11,042
The heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright, while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.

24
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:21,559
Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that past since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.

25
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:37,165
In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale, that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea, like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs.

26
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:49,281
His jets are erect, full, and black like soot, so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.

27
00:03:49,682 --> 00:04:05,042
Sea-fowls are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea-candies, and macaroni, which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back, and all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep,

28
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:17,220
leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff, caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.

29
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:23,790
Thus the foreground is all raging commotion, but behind, in admirable artistic contrast,

30
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:40,497
is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.

31
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:53,233
Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not, but my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman.

32
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:56,497
The French are the lads for painting action.

33
00:04:56,637 --> 00:05:05,488
Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas?

34
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:25,490
as in that triumphal hall at Versailles, where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of France, where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights, and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs.

35
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:32,337
Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea-battle pieces of garnery,

36
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:43,987
The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes.

37
00:05:44,167 --> 00:06:02,323
With not one-tenth of England's experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finnish sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale-hunt.

38
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:23,299
For the most part, the English and American whale draftsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale, which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid.

39
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:51,683
Even Scorsese, the justly renowned right whale-man, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhals and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat-hooks, chopping-knives, and grapnels, and, with the microscopic diligence of a loin-hook, submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six facsimiles of magnified Arctic snow-crystals.

40
00:06:52,844 --> 00:07:09,623
I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager, I honor him for a veteran, but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.

41
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:20,235
In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other French engravings worthy of note, by someone who subscribes himself, H. Durand,

42
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:28,349
One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts.

43
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:44,738
It is a quiet noon scene among the isles of the Pacific, a French whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background

44
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:47,767
both drooping together in the breezeless air.

45
00:07:47,948 --> 00:07:57,907
The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose.

46
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:03,958
The other engraving is quite a different affair, the ship Hovtu upon the open sea,

47
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:22,639
And in the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a right whale alongside the vessel, the act of cutting in huff over to the monster as if to a quay, and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase to whales in the distance.

48
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:25,664
The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use.

49
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:37,142
Three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole, while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stands half erect out of the water, like a rearing horse.

50
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:46,517
From the ship the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies, and to windward

51
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:54,955
A black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.
