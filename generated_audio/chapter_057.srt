Chapter 57 - Of Whales in Paint, in Teeth, in Wood, in Sheet Iron, in Stone, in Mountains, in Stars.

2
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:21,643
On Tower Hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a crippled beggar, or K-E-G-E-G-R, as the sailors say, holding a painted board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg.

3
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:31,860
There are three whales and three boats, and one of the boats, presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity, is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale.

4
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:39,075
Any time these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world.

5
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:42,200
But the time of his justification has now come.

6
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:52,836
His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in whopping, at any rate, and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings.

7
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:59,687
But, though forever mounted on that stump, never a stump speech does the poor whaleman make.

8
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:04,455
but with downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation.

9
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:20,882
Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket and New Bedford and Sag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whale teeth, or ladies' busks wrought out of the right whale bone,

10
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:31,514
and other like scrimshander articles, as the whalemen call, the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material in their hours of ocean leisure.

11
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:38,141
Some of them have little boxes of dentistical looking implements, specially intended for the scrimshandering business.

12
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:50,295
But, in general, they toil with their jackknives alone, and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor, they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariner's fancy.

13
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:58,098
Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him, i.e.

14
00:01:58,158 --> 00:01:59,280
what is called savagery.

15
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:02,928
Your true whale hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois.

16
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:10,663
I myself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals, and ready at any moment to rebel against him.

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,087
Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry.

18
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:28,778
An ancient Hawaiian war club or spear paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.

19
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:39,790
For, with but a bit of broken seashell or a shark's tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden network has been achieved, and it has cost steady years of steady application.

20
00:02:39,905 --> 00:03:05,625
As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor savage, with the same marvelous patience and with the same single shark's tooth of his one poor jackknife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite as workmanlike, but as close-packed in its maziness of design as the Greek savage Achilles' shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prince of that fine old Dutch savage Albert Durer.

21
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:15,000
Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea warwood, are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers.

22
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:17,825
Some of them are done with much accuracy.

23
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:25,437
At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the roadside door.

24
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:28,761
When the porter is sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best.

25
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,947
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays.

26
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:39,656
On the spires of some old-fashioned churches, you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weathercocks.

27
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:47,626
But they are so elevated, and besides that, are to all intents and purposes so labeled with, hands off.

28
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,812
You cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit.

29
00:03:52,332 --> 00:04:12,535
In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high, broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges.

30
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:26,872
Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveler is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights, here and there, from some lucky point of view, you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges.

31
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:30,979
But you must be a thorough whaleman to see these sights.

32
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:41,695
And not only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first standpoint.

33
00:04:41,894 --> 00:05:00,375
else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your precise previous standpoint would require a laborious rediscovery, like the Salama Islands, which still remain incognita, though once high-ruffed Mendana trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.

34
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:15,216
nor, when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them, as when long filled with thoughts of war, the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds.

35
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:23,427
Thus at the north have I chased Leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me.

36
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:34,650
and beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo Novus, and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the flying fish.

37
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:49,195
With a frigate's anchors from my bridle bits and fasses of harpoons for spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight?
