Chapter 7 THE CHAPEL

2
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:14,819
In this same New Bedford there stands a whaleman's chapel, and few are the moony fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,522
I am sure that I did not.

4
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:21,089
Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this special errand.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,059
The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold to driving sleet and mist.

6
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,945
Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin,

7
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,888
I thought my way against the stubborn storm.

8
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:41,555
Entering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors' wives and widows.

9
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:47,221
A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm.

10
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:56,251
Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable.

11
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:58,253
The chaplain had not yet arrived,

12
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:10,114
And there the silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit.

13
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:14,261
Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not pretend to quote.

14
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:22,435
Sackard, to the memory of John Talbot, who, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard, near the Isle of Desolation,

15
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:35,937
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG.

16
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:41,065
Willis Ellery, Nathan Coleman, Walter Kenney, Seth Macy, and Samuel Gleig.

17
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:49,016
forming one of the boat's crews of the ship Eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the offshore ground in the Pacific, December 31st, 1839.

18
00:01:49,056 --> 00:02:04,757
This marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates, blank-blank sacred to the memory of the late Captain Ezekiel Hardy, who in the bowels of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of Japan, August 3d, 1833,

19
00:02:04,737 --> 00:02:07,802
This tablet is erected to his memory by his widow.

20
00:02:08,784 --> 00:02:18,341
Shaking off the slate from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself near the door, and, turning sideways, was surprised to see Queequeg near me.

21
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:26,475
Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wandering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.

22
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:40,131
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance, because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.

23
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:51,163
Whether any of the relatives of the seaman whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not, but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery

24
00:02:51,143 --> 00:03:10,097
And so plainly did several women present where the countenance, if not the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.

25
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:22,528
Oh, ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass, Whose standing among flowers can say here, Here lies my beloved, ye know not the desolation That broods in bosoms like these.

26
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,580
What bitter blanks in those black boarded marbles Which cover no ashes?

27
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,247
What despair in those immovable inscriptions!

28
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:43,003
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave!

29
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:47,954
As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.

30
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,202
In what senses of living creatures the dead of mankind are included?

31
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:53,888
Why, it is that a universal proverb says of them.

32
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,478
But they tell no tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin sands.

33
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:21,377
How it is that to his name, who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so significant an infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth, while the life-insurance-paid death-forfeitures, upon immortals, upon immortals, upon immortals, immortals, invotals, invotal, unstirring, paralysisâ€”all these things are not without their meanings.

34
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:29,408
But faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.

35
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:43,568
It needs scarcely to be told with what feelings, on the eve of an unducate voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light of that darkened, doleful day, read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me.

36
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:48,065
Yes, Shmael, the same fate may be thine.

37
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:50,428
But somehow I grew merry again.

38
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:59,498
Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems I, a stove-boat will make me an immortal by brevet.

39
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:07,087
Yes, there is death in this business of wailing a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity.

40
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:07,928
But what then?

41
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:12,373
Bethings we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death.

42
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:17,419
Bethings that what they call my shadow here on earth Is my true substance.

43
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:27,412
Methinks that, in looking at things spiritual, We are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, And thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.

44
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:31,457
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.

45
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,461
In fact, take my body, who will?

46
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,944
Take it, I say, it is not me.

47
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:40,048
And therefore three cheers for Nantucket,

48
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:47,102
And come a stove-boat and stove-body when they will, For stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.
