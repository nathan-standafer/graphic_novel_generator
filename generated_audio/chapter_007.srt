00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,993
Chapter 7.

2
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:02,355
The Chapel.

3
00:00:03,457 --> 00:00:13,496
In this same New Bedford there stands a whaleman's chapel, and few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.

4
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:15,660
I am sure that I did not.

5
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:20,480
Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this special errand.

6
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:25,086
The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold to driving sleet and mist.

7
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:31,953
Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.

8
00:00:32,854 --> 00:00:38,020
Entering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors' wives and widows.

9
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:43,707
A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm.

10
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:50,676
Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable.

11
00:00:51,477 --> 00:01:04,092
The chaplain had not yet arrived, and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit.

12
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:19,151
Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not pretend to quote, spread to the memory of John Talbot, who at the age of 18 was lost overboard near the Isle of Desolation off Patagonia, November 1st, 1836.

13
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:25,303
This tablet is erected to his memory by his sister.

14
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:40,144
sictor to the memory of Robert Long, Willis, Ellery, Nathan Kaleeman, Walter Canney, Seth Macy, and Samuel Gleig, forming one of the boat's crews of the ship Eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the offshore ground in the Pacific, December 31st, 1839.

15
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:44,510
This marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates.

16
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:48,996
Sack, Sea, aired to the memory of the late C.A.T.

17
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:59,914
Captain E. Z. C. E. E. L. Hardy, who in the bows of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of Japan, August 3, 1833.

18
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:03,280
This tablet is erected to his memory.

19
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:05,905
B. Y. His Waido.

20
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,689
Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself near the door and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me.

21
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:21,557
Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.

22
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:33,850
This savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance, because he was the only one who could not read and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.

23
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:41,073
Whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not.

24
00:02:41,533 --> 00:03:01,002
But so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance, if not the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.

25
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:22,255
Ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass, Who standing among flowers can say, Here, here lies my beloved.

26
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:26,162
Ye know not the desolation That broods in bosoms like these.

27
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:31,512
What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles Which cover no ashes!

28
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,365
What despair in those immovable inscriptions!

29
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:45,585
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave!

30
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:50,042
As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.

31
00:03:50,784 --> 00:04:02,595
In what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included, why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though containing more secrets than the Goodwin sands.

32
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:26,160
How it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth, why the life insurance companies pay death forfeitures upon immortals, in what eternal, unstirring paralysis and deadly, hopeless trance yet lies antique, Adam who died sixty round centuries ago.

33
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,625
How it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain.

34
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,568
All these things are not without their meanings.

35
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:39,778
But faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.

36
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:51,936
It needs scarcely to be told with what feelings, on the eve of a Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light of that darkened, doleful day, read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me.

37
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:55,802
Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.

38
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:58,260
but somehow I grew merry again.

39
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,158
Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion it seems.

40
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:07,615
Aye, a stove-boat will make me an immortal by brevet.

41
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:14,483
Yes, there is death in this business of whaling, a speechlessly quick, chaotic bundling of a man into eternity.

42
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:15,865
But what then?

43
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:19,469
Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death.

44
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,975
Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance.

45
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:32,826
Methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.

46
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:35,713
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.

47
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:39,963
In fact, take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.

48
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:48,503
And therefore three cheers for Nantucket, And come a stove-boat and stove-body when they will, For stave my soul Jove himself cannot.
