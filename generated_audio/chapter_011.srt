00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:13,223
Chapter 11 - Nightgown. We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown-tattooed legs over mine and then drawing them back.

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,892
So entirely sociable and free and easy were we.

3
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:28,063
When, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what little knappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting up again, though daybreak was yet some way down the future.

4
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:34,476
Yes, we became very wakeful, so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome

5
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:47,031
and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up, the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the headboard with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if our knee-pans were warming-pans.

6
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:57,223
We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors, indeed out of bedclothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the room.

7
00:00:57,676 --> 00:01:07,251
The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is.

8
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:11,137
Merely by contrast, nothing exists in itself.

9
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:19,330
If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable anymore.

10
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:30,766
But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm?

11
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:38,017
For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich.

12
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:45,908
For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air.

13
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:49,834
Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.

14
00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:55,743
We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at once I thought I would open my eyes.

15
00:01:56,364 --> 00:02:08,723
For when between sheets, whether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed.

16
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:22,122
Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed, as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part.

17
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:34,973
Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve o'clock at night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion.

18
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:47,147
Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake, and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk.

19
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:57,899
Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.

20
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:06,909
For now, I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then.

21
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:12,375
I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord's policy of insurance.

22
00:03:12,355 --> 00:03:18,568
I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.

23
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:32,415
With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue-hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.

24
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:39,143
Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far-distant scenes, I know not.

25
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:45,811
But he now spoke of his native island, and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it.

26
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,813
He gladly complied.

27
00:03:48,248 --> 00:04:03,237
Though at the time I but ill-comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.
