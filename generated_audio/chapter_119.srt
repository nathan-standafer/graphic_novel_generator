1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,992
Chapter 119 - The Candles.

2
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:02,635
Chapter 119 - The Candles.

3
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:05,920
Warmest climbs but nurse the cruelest fangs.

4
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:10,327
The tiger of Bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure.

5
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:14,113
Skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders.

6
00:00:14,654 --> 00:00:18,420
Gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands.

7
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:26,713
So, too, it is that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms, the typhoon.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:33,536
It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.

9
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:41,843
Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas and bare-pulled was left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly ahead.

10
00:00:42,364 --> 00:00:55,435
When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its aftersport.

11
00:00:55,415 --> 00:01:10,519
Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarterdeck, at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there, while Stub and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats.

12
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,003
But all their pains seemed not.

13
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:19,633
Though lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarterboat Ahab's did not escape,

14
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:30,400
A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship's high teetering side, stove in the boat's bottom at the stern and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.

15
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:35,373
Bad work, bad work, Mr. Starbuck," said Stubb, regarding the wreck.

16
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:37,316
But the sea will have its way.

17
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:39,638
Stubb, for one, can't fight it.

18
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,745
You see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps.

19
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:48,089
All round the world it runs, and then comes the spring.

20
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,815
But as for me, all the start I have to meet it is just across the deck here.

21
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:58,362
But never mind, it's all in fun, so the old song says, Assigns.

22
00:01:58,342 --> 00:01:58,803
Oh!

23
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:03,614
Jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A-flourish in his tail.

24
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,805
Such a funny, sporty, gamey, jesty, Jokey, hokey-pokey lad is the ocean.

25
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:09,246
Oh!

26
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:14,899
The scud all a-flyin', That's his flip-only foamin', When he stirs in the spicin'.

27
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,084
Such a funny, sporty, gamey, jesty, jokey, hokey-pokey lad is the ocean, oh!

28
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:25,789
Thunder splits the ships, but he only smacks his lips, a tastin' of this flip.

29
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,755
Such a funny, sporty, gamey, jesty, jokey, hokey-pokey lad is the ocean, oh!

30
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:38,081
A vast stub, cried Starbuck, let the typhoon sing and strike his harp here in our rigging.

31
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,344
But if thou art a brave man, thou wilt hold thy peace.

32
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:43,806
But I am not a brave man.

33
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:45,428
Never said I was a brave man.

34
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,852
I am a coward, and I sing to keep up my spirits.

35
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:51,616
And I tell you what it is, Mr. Starbuck.

36
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:55,481
There's no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat.

37
00:02:56,282 --> 00:03:00,627
And when that's done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind-up.

38
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:04,652
Madman, look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.

39
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:05,534
What?

40
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:11,481
How can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never mind how foolish?

41
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:11,861
"'Here!'

42
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:16,185
cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder and pointing his hand towards the weather-bow.

43
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:24,293
"'Markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run from Moby-Dick, the very course he swung to this day noon?

44
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:25,894
Now mark his boat there.

45
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:27,115
Where is that stove?'

46
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:30,458
"'In the stern-sheets, man, where he is wont to stand.

47
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,540
His stand-point is stove, man.

48
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,563
Now jump overboard, and sing away if thou must.'

49
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,886
"'I don't half understandee what's in the wind.

50
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:46,976
Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket, soliloquize Starbucks suddenly, heedless of Stubbs' question.

51
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:53,845
The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home.

52
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:59,452
Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom, but to leeward, homeward.

53
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:03,017
I see it lightens up there, but not with the lightning.

54
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:13,480
At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the flashes, a voice was heard at his side, and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.

55
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:14,742
Who's there?

56
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:15,784
Old Thunder!

57
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:24,600
said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot hole, but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire.

58
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:36,316
Now, as the lightning rod to aspire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil, so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water.

59
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:40,446
But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth,

60
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:55,482
that its end may avoid all contact with the hull, and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the vessel's way in the water.

61
00:04:55,462 --> 00:05:10,540
Because of all this, the lower parts of a ship's lightning rods are not always overboard, but are generally made in long, slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.

62
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,921
The rods!

63
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:12,802
The rods!

64
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:20,972
cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeau to light Ahab to his post.

65
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:22,474
Are they overboard?

66
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:23,355
Drop them over!

67
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:24,196
Fore and aft!

68
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:25,317
Quick!

69
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:26,056
"'Avast!'

70
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:26,997
cried Ahab.

71
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:29,921
"'Let's have fair play here, though we be the weaker side.

72
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:36,771
Yet I'll contribute to raise rods on the Himmels and Andes, that all the world may be secured, but out on privileges.

73
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:39,856
Let them be secured, but out on privileges.'

74
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,037
"'Look aloft!'

75
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:42,239
cried Starbuck.

76
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,401
"'The Corpusants!

77
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:44,502
The Corpusants!'

78
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:50,511
All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire, and touched at each tri-pointed lightning rod.

79
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:53,261
end with three tapering white flames.

80
00:05:53,721 --> 00:06:01,053
Each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulfurous air, like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.

81
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,516
Blast the boat!

82
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:03,457
Let it go!

83
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:13,654
cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand as he was passing a lashing.

84
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:15,537
Blast it!

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:24,570
But slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames, and immediately shifting his tone, he cried, The corporacants have mercy on us all.

86
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:27,674
To sailors, oaths are household words.

87
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:31,839
They will swear in the trance of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest.

88
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:38,807
They will imprecate curses from the top sail-yard arms, when most they teeter over to a seething sea.

89
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:50,166
But in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when God's burning finger has been laid on the ship, when his mene, mene, tekel ufarsin, has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.

90
00:06:50,847 --> 00:07:04,609
While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the enchanted crew, who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a faraway constellation of stars.

91
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:15,325
Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic jet negro, Dagu, loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come.

92
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:25,032
The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpuscants while lit up by the preternatural light.

93
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:29,698
Kwekwek's tattooing burned like satanic blue flames on his body.

94
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:38,950
The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft, and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall.

95
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:43,052
A moment or two passed when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against someone.

96
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:44,274
It was Stubb.

97
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:46,437
What thinkest thou now, man?

98
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:47,499
I heard thy cry.

99
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:49,202
It was not the same in the song.

100
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:51,546
No, no, it wasn't, I said.

101
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:55,353
The Corpuscants have mercy on us all, and I hope they will still.

102
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:58,057
But do they only have mercy on long faces?

103
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:00,221
Have they no bowels for a laugh?

104
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:02,104
And look ye, Mr. Starbuck.

105
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,448
But it's too dart to look.

106
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:05,129
Hear me then.

107
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:08,612
I take that masthead flame we saw for a sign of good luck.

108
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:13,717
For those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock-a-block with sperm oil, Dicey.

109
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:18,341
And so, all that sperm will work up into the masts like sap in a tree.

110
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:22,465
Yes, our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles.

111
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,467
That's the good promise we saw."

112
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:30,192
At that moment, Starbot caught sight of Stubbs' face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight.

113
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:32,494
Glancing upwards, he cried,

114
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:32,955
See!

115
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:33,757
See!"

116
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:40,432
And once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor.

117
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:44,482
The Corpuscants have mercy on us all, cried Stubb again.

118
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:51,478
At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon in the flame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's front.

119
00:08:51,458 --> 00:09:08,215
but with his head bowed away from him while nearby, from the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered together and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig.

120
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:19,947
In various enchanted attitudes, like the standing or stepping or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck, but all their eyes upcast.

121
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:21,885
"'Aye, aye, men,' cried Ahab.

122
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:26,610
"'Look up at it, mark it well, the white flame but lights the way to the white well.

123
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:49,174
Hand me those mainmast links there, I would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it, blood against fire, so—' Then turning, the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot upon the parsie, and with fixed upward eye and high-flung right arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.

124
00:09:49,154 --> 00:10:06,730
O thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this hour I bear the scar, I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know that thy right worship is defiance.

125
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:13,777
To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind, and e'en for hate thou canst but kill, and all are killed.

126
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:16,900
No fearless fool now fronts thee.

127
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:26,010
I own thy speechless, placeless power, but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me.

128
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:41,366
In the midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here, though but a point at best, when so'er I came, where so'er I go, yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me and feels her royal rights.

129
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:45,570
But war is pain and hate is woe.

130
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,174
Come in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee.

131
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:52,579
But at thy highest, come as mere supernal power.

132
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,466
And though thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that in here that still remains indifferent.

133
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:05,955
O thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.

134
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:11,522
Sudden repeated flashes of lightning, the nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice their previous.

135
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:17,049
Ahab with the rest closes his eyes, his right hand pressed hard upon them.

136
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,334
I own thy speechless, placeless power, said I, not so?

137
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:25,239
Nor was it wrung from me, nor do I now drop these links.

138
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,182
Thou canst blind, but I can then grope.

139
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:31,386
Thou canst blind, but I can then grope.

140
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:34,561
Thou canst consume, but I can then be ashes.

141
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:36,425
I would not take it.

142
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:39,131
The lightning flashes through my skull.

143
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:41,597
Mine eyeballs ache and ache.

144
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,568
My whole beaten brain seems as beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground.

145
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,031
Oh, oh!

146
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:51,619
Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee.

147
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:58,016
Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness, But I am darkness leaping out of light, Leaping out of thee.

148
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:08,460
The javelins cease, open eyes, see or not, There burn the flames, O thou magnanimous, Now I do glory in my genealogy.

149
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,284
But thou art but my fiery father, my sweet mother I know not.

150
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:15,088
O cruel, what hast thou done with her?

151
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:18,011
There lies my puzzle, but thine is greater.

152
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:22,356
Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten.

153
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:26,921
Certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun.

154
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:32,187
I know that of me which thou knowest not of thyself, O thou omnipotent.

155
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:40,640
There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical.

156
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:45,888
Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it.

157
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:54,782
O thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.

158
00:12:54,998 --> 00:13:00,307
Here again, with haughty agony, I read my sire, Leap, leap up, and lick the sky.

159
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:05,815
I leap with thee, I burn with thee, Would fain be welded with thee, Defyingly I worship thee.

160
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:10,543
The boat, the boat, cried Starbuck, Look at thy boat, old man.

161
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:19,336
Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whaleboat's bow.

162
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:29,190
But the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off, and from the keen steel barb there now came a leveled flame of pale, fort fire.

163
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:34,662
As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm.

164
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:35,904
God!

165
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:37,866
God is against thee, old man!

166
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:38,647
Forbear!

167
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,470
Tis an ill voyage, ill begun, ill continued.

168
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:49,017
Let me square the yards while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this.

169
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:56,545
Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces, though not a sail was left aloft.

170
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:59,593
For the moment all the aghast mate's thoughts seemed theirs.

171
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:13,312
They raised a half-mutinous cry, but dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them, swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope's end.

172
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:19,461
Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held,

173
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:32,016
The men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke, All your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine, And heart, soul and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound.

174
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:39,184
And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats, Look ye here, thus I blow out the last fear.

175
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,930
And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.

176
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:58,267
As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe, because so much the more, a mark for thunderbolts.

177
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:03,960
So at those last words of Ahab's many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay.
