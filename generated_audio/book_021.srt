00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,453
Book XXX.

2
00:00:02,575 --> 00:00:08,603
The Trial of the Axes, during which Ulysses reveals himself to Eumaeus and Philoetus.

3
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:18,938
Minerva now put it in Penelope's mind to make the suitors try their skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves, as a means of bringing about their destruction.

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,845
She went upstairs and got the storeroom key which was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory,

5
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:39,370
She then went with her maidens into the storeroom at the end of the house, where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in Lacedaemon, Iphitus the son of Eurytus.

6
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:54,193
The two fell in with one another in Messena at the house of Autolochus, where Ulysses was staying in order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people, for the Messanians had carried off 300 sheep from Ithaca and had sailed away with them and with their shepherds.

7
00:00:54,974 --> 00:01:01,965
In quest of these Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them.

8
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:08,443
Iphitus had gone there also to try and get back twelve broodmares that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running with them.

9
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:27,075
These mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went to the house of Jove's son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules to his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven's vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set before Iphitus.

10
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:30,338
but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares himself.

11
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:39,948
It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his death had been left by him to his son.

12
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:52,320
Ulysses gave him in return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship, although they never visited at one another's houses, for Jove's son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so.

13
00:01:52,300 --> 00:02:04,900
This bow then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when he sailed for Troy, he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.

14
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:08,326
Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the storeroom.

15
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:16,519
The carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get it quite straight, he had then set the door-posts into it and hung the doors.

16
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:22,827
She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the doors.

17
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:27,092
One sixty-one these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a meadow.

18
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:34,962
And Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where the chest stood in which the fair linen and clothes were lay by, along with fragrant herbs.

19
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:39,908
Reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow-case from the peg on which it hung.

20
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:52,475
She sat down with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved her, she went to the cloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow in the quiver with the many deadly arrows that were inside it.

21
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:59,770
Along with her came her maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as prizes.

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:08,774
When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the bearing posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before her face, and with a maid on either side of her.

23
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:16,594
Then she said, Listen to me, you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of this house because its owner has been long absent.

24
00:03:16,574 --> 00:03:36,288
And without other pretext than that you want to marry me, this, then, being the prize that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth.

25
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:40,675
But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.

26
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:48,671
As she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron before the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had bidden him.

27
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:54,041
Hard by the stockman wept also when he saw his master's bow, but Antinus scolded them.

28
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,488
You country louts, said he, silly simpletons.

29
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:01,836
Why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying in this way?

30
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:04,260
She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her husband.

31
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,610
Sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind you.

32
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:18,343
We suitors shall have to contend for it with might and main, for we shall find it no light matter to string such a bow as this is.

33
00:04:18,363 --> 00:04:25,815
There is not a man of us all who is such another as Ulysses, for I have seen him and remember him, though I was then only a child.

34
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:41,072
This was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses, whom he was dishonoring in his own house, egging the others on to do so also.

35
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:43,034
Then Telemachus spoke.

36
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:46,999
Great heavens, he exclaimed, Jove must have robbed me of my senses.

37
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:55,330
Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying myself as though there were nothing happening.

38
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,817
But, suitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward.

39
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:06,571
It is for a woman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycenae, nor yet in Ithaca, nor on the mainland.

40
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:08,615
You know this as well as I do.

41
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:11,140
What need have I to speak in praise of my mother?

42
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:16,710
Come on then, make no excuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no.

43
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:27,301
I too will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father won before me."

44
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:32,367
As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and took his sword from his shoulder.

45
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:39,254
First he set the axes in a row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had made straight by line 162.

46
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:45,381
Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised when they saw him set them up so orderly,

47
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,466
though he had never seen anything of the kind before.

48
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:51,073
This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial of the bow.

49
00:05:51,594 --> 00:06:00,754
Thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he had to leave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron.

50
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:06,864
He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign to check him in spite of all his eagerness.

51
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:17,501
So he said, Alas, I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am too young and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to hold my own if anyone attacks me.

52
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:24,092
You others, therefore, who were stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.

53
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:30,639
On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door that led into the house, with the arrow standing against the top of the bow.

54
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:41,471
Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous said, Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the place at which the cup-bearer begins when he is handing round the wine.

55
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:46,176
The rest agreed, and Laodice son of Oenops was the first to rise.

56
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:51,582
He was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near the mixing bowl.

57
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:52,083
63.

58
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:57,212
He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and was indignant with the others.

59
00:06:57,813 --> 00:07:07,090
He was now the first to take the bow and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard work,

60
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,140
They therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, My friends, I cannot string it.

61
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:13,363
Let another have it.

62
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:23,904
This bow shall take the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better to die than to live after having missed the prize that we have so long striven for, and which has brought us so long together.

63
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:28,453
Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marry Penelope.

64
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:37,749
But when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo and make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win her.

65
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:44,400
On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door with the arrow standing against the tip of the bow.

66
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:51,634
Then he took his seat again on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous rebuked him, saying, Laodice, what are you talking about?

67
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:54,078
Your words are monstrous and intolerable.

68
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:55,982
It makes me angry to listen to you.

69
00:07:56,443 --> 00:08:02,254
Shall then this bow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend it yourself?

70
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:06,821
True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are others who will soon string it.

71
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:14,253
Then he said to Melanthius the Goatherd, Look sharp, light a fire in the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheepskin on it.

72
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:18,319
Bring us also a large ball of lard from what they have in the house.

73
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:19,961
Let us warm the bow and grease it.

74
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:23,724
We will then make trial of it again, and bring the contest to an end."

75
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:28,268
Melanthius lit the fire and set a seat covered with sheepskins beside it.

76
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:37,697
He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it.

77
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:45,724
Nevertheless, there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were the ringleaders among the suitors, and much the foremost among them all.

78
00:08:46,615 --> 00:08:51,104
Then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and Ulysses followed them.

79
00:08:51,786 --> 00:09:02,548
When they had got outside the gates and the outer yard, Ulysses said to them quietly, Stockman and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in doubt whether to say or no, but I think I will say it.

80
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:12,619
What manner of men would you be to stand by Ulysses if some god should bring him back here all of a sudden, say which you are disposed to do, to side with the suitors or with Ulysses?

81
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,104
Father Jove, answered the stockman, would indeed that you might so ordain it.

82
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:23,150
If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should see with what might and main I would fight for him.

83
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:27,635
In like words, you mayest pray to all the gods that Ulysses might return.

84
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:32,080
When, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses said,

85
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,803
It is I, Ulysses, who am here.

86
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:38,611
I have suffered much, but at last, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country.

87
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:45,604
I find that you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for I have not heard any of the others praying for my return.

88
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:50,372
To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be.

89
00:09:50,352 --> 00:10:01,825
If heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will find wives for both of you, will give you house and holding close to my own, and you shall be to me as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus.

90
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:06,050
I will now give you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured.

91
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:11,657
See, here is the scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on Matino on Matino.

92
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,200
Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.

93
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:26,224
As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw their arms round him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses kissed their hands and faces in return.

94
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:35,884
The sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said, Cease your weeping, lest someone should come outside and see us, and tell those who are within.

95
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:38,989
When you go in, do so separately, not both together.

96
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:41,632
I will go first, and you follow afterwards.

97
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:44,236
Let this, moreover, be the token between us.

98
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:48,422
The suitors will all of them try to prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver.

99
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:53,029
Do you, therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about,

100
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,474
and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment.

101
00:10:55,975 --> 00:11:00,725
If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not come out.

102
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:03,811
They must keep quiet and stay where they are at their work.

103
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:10,866
And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the doors of the outer court and to bind them securely at once."

104
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:14,514
When he had thus spoken he went back to the house and took the seat that he had left.

105
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,440
Presently his two servants followed him inside.

106
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:26,340
At this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was warming it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was greatly grieved.

107
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,107
He heaved a deep sigh and said, I grieve for myself and for us all.

108
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:39,219
I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca and elsewhere.

109
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:45,429
What I feel most is the fact of our being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot string his bow.

110
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:49,695
This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.

111
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,740
It shall not be so, Eurymachus," said Antinous, and you know it yourself.

112
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:59,547
Today is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land, who can string a bow on such a day as this.

113
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:00,949
Put it on one side.

114
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:06,235
As for the axes, they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the house and take them away.

115
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:12,122
Let the cup-bearer go round with his cups, that we may make our drink offerings, and drop this matter of the bow.

116
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:15,308
We will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats tomorrow.

117
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:23,645
The best he has, we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to an end."

118
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:32,963
The rest approved his words, and thereon men's servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while Pages filled the mixing bowls with wine and water,

119
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:35,787
and handed it round after giving every man his drink offering.

120
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:47,041
Then, when they had made their offerings, and had drunk each as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said, Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am minded.

121
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:52,448
I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who has just spoken with so much reason.

122
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:58,716
See shooting for the present, and leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will.

123
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:00,739
For the moment, however,

124
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:11,235
Give me the bow that I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I still have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and neglect have made an end of it.

125
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,795
This made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow.

126
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:21,886
Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely, saying, Wretched creature, you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body.

127
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:31,740
You ought to think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your bettors, without having any smaller portion served you than we others have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation.

128
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:36,067
No other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves.

129
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:40,834
The wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all those who drink immoderately.

130
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:46,294
It was wine that inflamed the centaur Eurycian when he was staying with Perithous among the Lapithae.

131
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:51,140
When the wine had got into his head, he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of Perithous.

132
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:56,487
This angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils.

133
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:04,077
Then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed and bore the burden of his crime, bereft of understanding.

134
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:08,543
Henceforth, therefore, there was war between mankind and the centaurs.

135
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:11,006
but he brought it upon himself through his own drunkenness.

136
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:15,513
In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you string the bow.

137
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:22,703
You will find no mercy from anyone here, for we shall at once ship you off to King Aketus, who kills everyone that comes near him.

138
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:28,731
You will never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger than yourself.

139
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:37,804
Penelope then spoke to him, and Tinnitus said she, It is not right that you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house.

140
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:45,533
If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make me his wife?

141
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:48,563
Even the man himself can have no such idea in his mind.

142
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,207
None of you need let that disturb his feasting.

143
00:14:51,648 --> 00:14:52,911
It would be out of all reason."

144
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:58,641
Queen Penelope answered Eurymachus, "'We do not suppose that this man will take you away with him.

145
00:14:59,022 --> 00:14:59,803
It is impossible.

146
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:08,179
But we are afraid lest some of the basersort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go gossiping about and say, these suitors are a feeble folk.

147
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:17,577
They are paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.

148
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:21,163
This is what will be said, and it will be a scandal against us."

149
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:29,138
Eurymachus Penelope answered, people who persist in eating up the earth, Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will?

150
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:33,285
This stranger is strong and well built, he says moreover, that he is of noble birth.

151
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,790
Give him the bow, and let us see whether he can string it or no."

152
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:49,150
I say, and it shall surely be that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and robbers, and a sharp sword.

153
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,717
I will also give him sandals, and will see him sent safely wherever he wants to go.

154
00:15:53,737 --> 00:15:55,800
Then Telemachus said,

155
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:03,389
Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in the islands that are over against Ellis who has the right to let anyone have the bow or to refuse it.

156
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:11,478
No one shall force me one way or the other, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the bow outright and let him take it away with him.

157
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:19,147
Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants.

158
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:25,534
This bow is a man's matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master here.

159
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:29,706
She went wandering back into the house and laid her son's saying in her heart.

160
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:36,766
Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.

161
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:40,857
The swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses,

162
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:47,310
But the suitors clamored at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one of them said, You idiot, where are you taking the bow to?

163
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,452
Are you out of your wits?

164
00:16:49,113 --> 00:16:56,167
If Apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer, your own boar hounds shall get you into some quiet little place and worry you to death.

165
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,119
Eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put the bow down then and there,

166
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:14,763
But Telemachus shouted out at him from the other side of the cloisters and threatened him, saying, Father Eumaeus, bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am, I will pelt you with stones back to the country, for I am the better man of the two.

167
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:19,652
I wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as I am than you,

168
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:23,057
I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry for they mean mischief."

169
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:32,389
Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put them in a better humor with Telemachus, so Eumaeus brought the bow on and placed it in the hands of Ulysses.

170
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:40,881
When he had done this, he called Eurycleia apart and said to her, Eurycleia, Telemachus says you are to close the doors of the women's apartments.

171
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:48,653
If they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work."

172
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:52,139
Eurycleia did as she was told and closed the doors of the women's apartments.

173
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,908
Meanwhile, Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer court.

174
00:17:57,888 --> 00:18:17,128
There was a ship's cable of byblus fibre lying in the gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about, and proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into its two horns during his absence.

175
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:28,587
Then, would one turn towards his neighbor saying, this is some tricky old bow fancier, either he has got one like it at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle it.

176
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:35,117
Another said, I hope he may be no more successful in other things than he is likely to be in stringing this bow.

177
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:44,407
But Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes the twisted gut fast at both ends.

178
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:51,056
Then he took it in his right hand to prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering of a swallow.

179
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:54,540
The suitors were dismayed and turned colour as they heard it.

180
00:18:55,181 --> 00:19:04,193
At that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him.

181
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:11,762
He took an arrow that was lying upon the table 165, for those which the Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver.

182
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:18,629
He laid it on the centerpiece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow and the string toward him, still seated on his seat.

183
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:28,180
When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle holes of the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them and into the outer courtyard.

184
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:32,745
Then he said to Telemachus, Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus.

185
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:36,432
I did not miss what I aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow.

186
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:39,919
I am still strong, and not as the suitors twit me with being.

187
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:51,902
Now, however, it is time for the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight, and then otherwise to desport themselves with song and dance which are the crowning ornaments of a banquet."

188
00:19:51,922 --> 00:20:00,218
As he spoke, he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father's seat.
