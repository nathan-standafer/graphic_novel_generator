00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:08,039
Chapter 129 - The Cabin. A. H. A. B. moving to go on deck, Pip catches him by the hand to follow.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,045
Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now.

3
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:18,791
The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee by him.

4
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:23,696
There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my malady.

5
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:29,802
Like cures like, and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired health.

6
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:34,390
Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee as if thou wert the captain.

7
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:37,896
Ay, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair.

8
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:39,859
Another screwed to it thou must be.

9
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,925
No, no, no, ye have not a whole body, sir.

10
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:45,549
Do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg.

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,112
Only tread upon me, sir.

12
00:00:47,593 --> 00:00:49,656
I ask no more, so I remain a part of ye.

13
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:53,022
Oh, I ask no more, so I remain a part of ye.

14
00:00:53,457 --> 00:01:05,433
Spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of man, and a black, and crazy, but methinks like cures, like applies to him too, he grows so sane again.

15
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:15,246
They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose drowned bones now show white for all the blackness of his living skin.

16
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:17,969
But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him.

17
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,191
Sir, I must go with ye.

18
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:25,296
If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab's purpose keels up in him.

19
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,678
I tell thee no, it cannot be.

20
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:32,884
O good master, master, master, weep so, and I will murder thee.

21
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:35,486
Have a care, for Ahab too is mad.

22
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:41,352
Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck and still know that I am there.

23
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:43,017
And now I quit thee.

24
00:01:43,057 --> 00:01:48,753
Thy hand, met, true art thou, lad, as the circumference to its center.

25
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:55,712
So, God forever bless thee, and if it come to that, God forever save thee, let what will befall.

26
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:59,118
AHAB goes, Pip steps one step forward.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,406
Here he this instant stood, I stand in his air, but I'm alone.

28
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:07,312
Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he's missing.

29
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:08,013
Pip!

30
00:02:08,374 --> 00:02:08,654
Pip!

31
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:09,316
Ding!

32
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:09,756
Dong!

33
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:10,137
Ding!

34
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:11,980
Who's seen Pip?

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,962
He must be up here.

36
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:14,223
Let's try the door.

37
00:02:14,864 --> 00:02:15,746
Let's try the door.

38
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:16,947
Let's try the door.

39
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:18,249
Let's try the door.

40
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:21,454
Neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar.

41
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,477
And yet there's no opening it.

42
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,320
It must be the spell.

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,426
He told me to stay here, I, and told me this screwed chair was mine.

44
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:37,258
Here, then, I'll seat me, against the transom, in the ship's full middle, all her keel and her three masts before me.

45
00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:46,119
Here, our old sailors say, in their black 74s great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants.

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:46,981
Ha!

47
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,122
What's this?

48
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:52,049
Epaulettes, epaulettes, the epaulettes all come crowding.

49
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,833
Pass round the decanters, glad to see ye.

50
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:55,955
Fill up, messieurs.

51
00:02:56,376 --> 00:03:01,564
What an odd feeling now, when a black boy's host to white men with gold lace upon their coats.

52
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:04,208
Messieurs, have ye seen one, Pip?

53
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:08,035
A little negro lad, five feet high, hangog look, and cowardly.

54
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:09,958
Jumped from a whale-boat once.

55
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:10,900
To seen him?

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,541
No.

57
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:13,725
Well then, fill up again, captains.

58
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:14,266
No.

59
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:18,734
Well then, fill up again, captains, and let's drink shame upon all cowards.

60
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:20,276
I name no names.

61
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:21,619
Shame upon them.

62
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,462
Put one foot upon the table.

63
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:25,245
Shame upon all cowards.

64
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:26,147
Hissed.

65
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,491
Above there I hear ivory.

66
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:33,151
Oh, master, master, I am indeed downhearted when you walk over me.

67
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:40,000
But here I'll stay, though this stern strikes rocks, and they bulge through, and oysters come to join me.
