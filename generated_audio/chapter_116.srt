Chapter 116 - The Dying Whale

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:15,484
Not seldom in this life when, on the right side, fortune's favourite sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out.

3
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,310
So seemed it with the Pequod.

4
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:24,259
For next day after encountering the gay bachelor, whales were seen and four were slain, and one of them by Ahab.

5
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:35,455
It was far down the afternoon, and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done, and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and whale both stilly died together.

6
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:52,894
Then such a sweetness and such plaintiveness, such in-breathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the Manila Isles the Spanish land breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.

7
00:00:53,694 --> 00:01:03,585
Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat.

8
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:10,656
for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm-whales dying, the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring.

9
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:18,189
That strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.

10
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:27,565
He turns and turns him to it, how slowly but how steadfastly, his homage rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions.

11
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:32,630
He too worships fire, most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun.

12
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,655
Oh, that these two favoring eyes should see these two favoring sights!

13
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:39,137
Look!

14
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:56,134
Here, far water-locked, beyond all hum of human weal or woe, in these most candid and impartial seas, where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets, where for long Chinese ages the billows have still rolled unspeechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the Niger's unknown source,

15
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:58,596
Here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith.

16
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:03,401
But see, no sooner dead than death whirls round the corpse, and it heads some other way.

17
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:12,550
O thou dark Hindu half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unvergered seas!

18
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:22,459
Thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the wide slaughtering typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after-calm.

19
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:28,806
Nor has this thy wail sunwards turned his dying head, And then gone round again, without a lesson to me.

20
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,129
O trebly hooped and welded hip of power!

21
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,052
O high-aspiring rainbow jet!

22
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,696
That one strivest, this one jettest all in vain.

23
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:46,925
In vain, O wail, dost thou seek intercedings With yon all-quickening sun, that only calls forth life, But gives it not again.

24
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:51,990
Yet dost thou, darker half, Rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith.

25
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,994
All thy unnameable eminglings float beneath me here.

26
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:59,859
I am buoyed by breaths of once living things, Exhaled as air, but water now.

27
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:07,128
Then hail, forever hail, O sea, In whose eternal tossings the wild fowl Finds his only rest.

28
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:15,177
Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea, Though hill and valley mothered me, Ye billows are my foster brothers.
