CHAPTER XXIII THE LEE SHORE Some chapters back one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, new-lented mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.

2
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:21,553
When on that shivering winter's night the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold, malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm but Bulkington?

3
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:25,617
I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man,

4
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:35,409
who in midwinter, just landed from a four years' dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term.

5
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,633
The land seemed scorching to his feet.

6
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:43,780
Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable deep memories yield no epitaphs.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,025
The six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkinton.

8
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:53,612
Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship,

9
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:56,317
That miserably drives along the lured land.

10
00:00:56,657 --> 00:01:08,638
The port would fain give succour, the port is pitiful, In the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, Warm blankets, friends, all that's kind to our mortality.

11
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:17,153
But in that gale, the port, the land, Is that ship's direst jeopardy, she must fly All hospitality, one touch of land,

12
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:21,812
Though it but graze the keel, Would make her shudder through and through.

13
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:39,563
With all her might she crowds all sail offshore In so doing, fights gains the very winds That feign would blow her homeward, Seeks all the lashed seas' landlessness again, For refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril Her only friend, her bitterest foe.

14
00:01:39,863 --> 00:02:04,167
Know ye now, Bulkington, glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth, that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea, while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slobbish shore, but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth,

15
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:14,447
Sureless, indefinite as God so, Better is it to perish in that howling infinite Than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, Even if that were safety.

16
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:19,697
For, worm-like then, O, Who would craven crawl to land?

17
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:21,080
Terrorous of the terrible!

18
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:23,224
Is all this agony so vain?

19
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:28,013
Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington, Bear thee grimly demigod.

20
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,664
Up from the spray Of thy ocean perishing straight up Leaps thy apotheosis.
