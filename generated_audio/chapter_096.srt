00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:08,923
Chapter 96 - The Try-works. Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her triworks.

2
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:17,375
She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship.

3
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:21,521
It is as if from the open field a brick kiln were transported to her planks.

4
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:27,709
The triworks are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most roomy part of the deck.

5
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:37,631
The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some 10 feet by 8 square and 5 in height.

6
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:48,682
The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides and screwing it down to the timbers.

7
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:55,789
On the flanks it is cased with wood, and atop completely covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway.

8
00:00:56,292 --> 00:01:02,301
Removing this hatch we expose the great tripods, two in number and each of several barrels capacity.

9
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:05,506
When not in use they are kept remarkably clean.

10
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:11,835
Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand till they shine within like silver punch bowls.

11
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:18,385
During the night watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap.

12
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:23,303
while employed in polishing them, one man in each pot, side by side.

13
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:27,771
Many confidential communications are carried on over the iron lips.

14
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:31,659
It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation.

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,226
It was in the left-hand tripod of the Pequod

16
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:51,169
with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time.

17
00:01:52,010 --> 00:02:03,306
Removing the fireboard from the front of the triworks, the bare masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces directly underneath the pots.

18
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:05,809
These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron.

19
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:15,740
The intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire enclosed surface of the works.

20
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:21,967
By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates.

21
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:24,010
There are no external chimneys.

22
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,072
They open direct from the rear wall.

23
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,855
And here let us go back for a moment.

24
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,527
It was about nine o'clock at night that the Pequod's triworks were first started on this present voyage.

25
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:37,331
It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business.

26
00:02:38,112 --> 00:02:38,692
Already there?

27
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:40,775
Off hatch, then, and start her.

28
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,078
You cook, fire the works.

29
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,527
This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage.

30
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:56,240
Here be it said that in a whaling voyage, the first fire in the triworks has to be fed for a time with wood.

31
00:02:57,101 --> 00:03:01,810
After that, no wood is used except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel.

32
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:11,447
In a word, after being tried out, the crisp, shriveled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous properties.

33
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,793
These fritters feed the flames.

34
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:22,969
Like a plethoric burning martyr or a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body.

35
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,193
Would that he consumed his own smoke?

36
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:33,908
For his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in it for the time.

37
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:40,526
It has an unspeakable wild Hindu odor about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres.

38
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:44,270
It smells like the left wing of the Day of Judgment.

39
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:46,273
It is an argument for the pit.

40
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:49,577
By midnight, the works were in full operation.

41
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:51,639
We were clear from the carcass.

42
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,961
Sail had been made.

43
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:54,563
The wind was freshening.

44
00:03:55,064 --> 00:03:57,887
The wild ocean darkness was intense.

45
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:08,755
But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek fire.

46
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:13,676
The burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed.

47
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:27,771
So the pitch and sulfur-frayed brigs of the bold hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors with broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates and folded them in conflagrations.

48
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:33,797
The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth in front of them.

49
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:40,272
Standing on this were the Tartarian shapes of the pagan Harponiers, always the whale-ship stokers.

50
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:53,404
With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted curling out of the doors to catch them by the feet.

51
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,646
The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps.

52
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:04,273
To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.

53
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:04,430
you

54
00:05:04,658 --> 00:05:09,726
Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass.

55
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,009
This served for a sea-sofa.

56
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:19,841
Here lounged the watch when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads.

57
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:34,362
Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works.

58
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:57,632
As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of mirth, as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the flames from the furnace, as to and fro in their front the harpooners wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers, as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived,

59
00:05:57,612 --> 00:06:08,227
and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea in the night, and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides.

60
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:21,004
Then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages and laden with fire and burning a corpse and plunger, so seemed it to me as I stood at her helm and for long hours silently guided the way of this fireship on the sea.

61
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:27,891
Wrapped, for that interval in darkness myself, I, but the better, saw the redness, the madness, the ghastliness of others.

62
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:33,276
The continual sight of the fiend shakes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire.

63
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:42,306
These, at last, begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.

64
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:48,612
But that night, in particular, a strange and ever since inexplicable thing occurred to me.

65
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:52,941
Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong.

66
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:56,990
The jawbone tiller smote my side, which leaned against it.

67
00:06:57,431 --> 00:07:01,540
In my ears was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the wind.

68
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:03,664
I thought my eyes were opened.

69
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:09,613
I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart.

70
00:07:10,315 --> 00:07:19,953
But, spite of all this, I could see no compass before me to steer by, though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it.

71
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:26,665
Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness.

72
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:36,364
Uppermost was the impression that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern.

73
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:40,710
A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over me.

74
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:50,001
Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted.

75
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:51,783
My God!

76
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:53,345
What is the matter with me?

77
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:54,627
thought I.

78
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,049
Lo!

79
00:07:55,109 --> 00:08:02,081
in my brief sleep I had turned myself about and was fronting the ship's stern with my back to her prow and the compass.

80
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:10,716
In an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind and very probably capsizing her.

81
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:19,872
How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the Lee!

82
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:23,028
Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man.

83
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,575
Never dream with thy hand on the helm.

84
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:27,942
Turn not thy back to the compass.

85
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:30,669
Accept the first hint of the hitching tiller.

86
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:35,683
Believe not the artificial fire when its redness makes all things look ghastly.

87
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:39,832
Tomorrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright.

88
00:08:40,673 --> 00:08:47,327
Those who glared like devils in the forking flames, The morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief.

89
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:54,482
The glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp, All others but liars.

90
00:08:54,462 --> 00:09:05,270
Nevertheless, the sun hides not Virginia's dismal swamp, nor Rome's accursed Campania, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon.

91
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:11,526
The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two-thirds of this earth.

92
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:21,403
So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true, not true, or undeveloped, with books the same.

93
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:33,143
The truest of all men was the man of sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon's, and Ecclesiastes' is the fine hammered steel of woe, all is vanity.

94
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:59,097
A. L. L. This willful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon's wisdom yet, but he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell, calls Calper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men, and throughout a carefree lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise and therefore jolly,

95
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:06,270
Not that man is fitted to sit down on tombstones and break the green damp mold with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.

96
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:13,308
But even Solomon, he says, the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain, i.e.

97
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:16,275
even while living in the congregation of the dead.

98
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:22,910
Give not thyself up then to fire lest it invert thee, deaden thee, as for the time it did me.

99
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:38,972
There is a wisdom that is woe, but there is a woe that is madness, and there is a Catskill Eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.

100
00:10:38,952 --> 00:10:51,156
And even if he forever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains, so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.
