00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,544
Chapter 1 - Loomings 

2
00:00:03,026 --> 00:00:15,917
Call Me Ishmael. Some years ago, never mind how long precisely, having little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.

3
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:20,301
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.

4
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:34,915
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul, whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet,

5
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:45,925
And especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking people's hats off.

6
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:49,909
Then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

7
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,192
This is my substitute for pistol and ball.

8
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:57,496
With a philosophical flourish, Kato throws himself upon his sword.

9
00:00:58,056 --> 00:00:59,418
I quietly take to the ship.

10
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:02,100
There is nothing surprising in this.

11
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:09,304
If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

12
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:16,452
There now is your insular city of the Manhattos, belted round by wharves as Indian Isles by coral reefs.

13
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:18,854
Commerce surrounds it with her surf.

14
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:22,038
Right and left, the streets take you waterward.

15
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:31,868
Its extreme downtown is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.

16
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:33,979
Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,264
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.

18
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:43,013
Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence by Whitehall northward.

19
00:01:43,654 --> 00:01:44,435
What do you see?

20
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:52,388
Posted like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.

21
00:01:52,368 --> 00:02:03,770
Some leaning against the spiles, some seated upon the pier heads, some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China, some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep.

22
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:12,587
But these are all landsmen, of weekdays pent up in lathe and plaster, tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks.

23
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:13,793
How then is this?

24
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,716
Are the green fields gone?

25
00:02:16,076 --> 00:02:16,777
What do they hear?

26
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,019
But look!

27
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,606
Here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive.

28
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:23,967
Strange!

29
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:27,432
Nothing will content them but the extremist limit of the land.

30
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:31,538
Loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.

31
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:36,452
No, they must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in.

32
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:40,097
And there they stand, miles of them, leagues.

33
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:46,505
Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues, north, east, south, and west.

34
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:48,428
Yet here they all unite.

35
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:54,336
Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?

36
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:58,441
Once more, say you are in the country, in some high land of lakes.

37
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:05,990
Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.

38
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:08,073
There is magic in it.

39
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:12,559
Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries.

40
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:21,049
Stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.

41
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:29,740
Should you ever be a thirst in the great American desert, try this experiment if your caravan happened to be supplied with a metaphysical professor.

42
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:33,830
Yes, as everyone knows, meditation and water are wedded forever.

43
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:35,692
But here is an artist.

44
00:03:36,193 --> 00:03:43,982
He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Sako.

45
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,485
What is the chief element he employs?

46
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:52,532
There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within.

47
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:59,440
And here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle, and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.

48
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,528
Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hillside blue.

49
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:18,503
But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine tree shakes down its size like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.

50
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:26,272
Go visit the prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you weighed knee-deep among tiger lilies.

51
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:28,735
What is the one charm wanting?

52
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:29,669
Water!

53
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,696
There is not a drop of water there!

54
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:37,898
Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it?

55
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:50,722
Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach?

56
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:59,599
Why is almost every robust, healthy boy with a robust, healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea?

57
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:09,299
Why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land?

58
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,345
Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?

59
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:16,333
Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of Jove?

60
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:19,579
Surely all this is not without meaning.

61
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:29,055
And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned.

62
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:33,583
But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.

63
00:05:34,224 --> 00:05:38,932
It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life, and this is the key to it all.

64
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:45,043
Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes,

65
00:05:45,023 --> 00:05:47,578
and begin to be over-conscious of my lungs.

66
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,063
I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger.

67
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:57,961
For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.

68
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:06,234
Besides, passengers get seasick, grow quarrelsome, don't sleep of nights, do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing.

69
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:14,167
No, I never go as a passenger, nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a commodore, or a captain, or a cook.

70
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:18,895
I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them.

71
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:25,204
For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever.

72
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:33,415
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and whatnot.

73
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:44,511
And as for going as cook, though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on shipboard, yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls.

74
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:55,188
Though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.

75
00:06:56,049 --> 00:07:07,427
It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses, the pyramids

76
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:16,217
No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumbed down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal masthead.

77
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:22,824
True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.

78
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,848
And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough.

79
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:35,018
It touches one's sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardecanoots.

80
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:43,690
And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you.

81
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:52,884
The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.

82
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,127
But even this wears off in time.

83
00:07:55,748 --> 00:08:00,955
What of it if some old hunks of a sea captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks?

84
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:05,665
What does that indignity amount to, Wade, I mean in the scales of the New Testament?

85
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:15,589
Do you think the Archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance, who ain't a slave?

86
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,273
Tell me that.

87
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:38,012
Well then, however the old sea captains may order me about, however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right, that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way, either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is, and so the universal thump is passed round,

88
00:08:37,992 --> 00:08:41,657
and all hands should rub each other's shoulder blades and be content.

89
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:51,692
Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of.

90
00:08:52,573 --> 00:09:00,945
On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay, and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid.

91
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:06,710
The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us.

92
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:12,617
But b-e-a-i-n-g, paid, what will compare with it?

93
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:25,252
The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvelous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.

94
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:29,717
Ah, how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!

95
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,216
Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the four-castle deck.

96
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:44,245
For as in this world, headwinds are far more prevalent than winds from astern, that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim.

97
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:50,491
So, for the most part, the commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the fourcastle.

98
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:54,135
He thinks he breathes it first, but not so.

99
00:09:54,385 --> 00:10:01,313
In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.

100
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:09,742
But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage.

101
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:21,675
This the invisible police officer of the fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way, he can better answer than anyone else.

102
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:30,305
And, doubtless, my going on this wailing voyage formed part of the grand program of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago.

103
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:36,451
It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances.

104
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:40,816
I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this.

105
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:45,702
Grand contested election for the presidency of the United States.

106
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:48,465
Walling voyage by one Ishmael.

107
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:51,308
Bloody battle in Afghanistan.

108
00:10:51,575 --> 00:11:08,065
Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage-managers, the fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces.

109
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:30,504
Though I cannot tell why this was exactly, yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which, being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased free will and discriminating judgment.

110
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:36,330
Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself.

111
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:40,840
Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.

112
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:48,389
Then the wild and distant seas were he rolled his island bulk, the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale.

113
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:55,858
These, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.

114
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:05,710
With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements, but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote.

115
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,879
I love to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts.

116
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:15,532
Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with it.

117
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:16,735
Would they let me?

118
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:22,568
Since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.

119
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:43,324
By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome, the great floodgates of the wonder world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, midmost of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
