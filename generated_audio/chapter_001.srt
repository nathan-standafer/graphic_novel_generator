00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,523
Chapter 1 Loomings Call me Ishmael.

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:17,023
Some years ago, never mind how long, precisely having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.

3
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:22,829
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.

4
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:34,240
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul, whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses,

5
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:47,614
and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet, and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street.

6
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:55,422
And methodically knocking people's hats off, then, I account at high time to get to see as toâ€” This is my substitute for pistol and ball.

7
00:00:55,982 --> 00:01:00,066
With a philosophical flourish, Cato throws himself upon his sword.

8
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:02,809
I quietly take to the ship.

9
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,932
There is nothing surprising in this.

10
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:14,125
If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

11
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:24,320
There, now, is your insular city of the Manhattos, belted round by wharves as Indian Isles by coral-reefs commerce surrounds it with her surf.

12
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,885
Right and left, the streets take you waterward.

13
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:38,784
Its extreme downtown is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.

14
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:42,310
Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

15
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,435
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.

16
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:52,287
Go from Courier's Hook to Cointy Slip, and from thence by White Hall northward.

17
00:01:52,267 --> 00:02:14,477
What you see, posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries, some leaning against the spiles, some seated upon the pier-heads, some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China, some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peak.

18
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:16,270
Stop!

19
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,436
But these are all landsmen of weekdays, pent up in lath and plaster tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks.

20
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,238
How then is this?

21
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,159
Are the green fields gone?

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,921
What are they here?

23
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:35,647
But look, here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive.

24
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:37,028
Strange!

25
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:41,112
Nothing will content them but the extremist limit of the land.

26
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:45,696
Loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.

27
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:51,266
No, they must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can, without falling in.

28
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,773
In there they stand miles of them leagues.

29
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,737
Inlanders all!

30
00:02:56,757 --> 00:03:02,087
They come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues, north, east, south, and west.

31
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:04,311
Yet here they all unite.

32
00:03:04,812 --> 00:03:05,473
Tell me,

33
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:10,622
Does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?

34
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:16,793
Once more, say you are in the country, in some high land of lakes.

35
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:25,088
Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.

36
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,192
There is magic in it.

37
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:40,770
Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reverie, stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.

38
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:50,884
Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor.

39
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:55,993
Yes, as everyone knows, meditation and water are wedded forever.

40
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:58,359
But here is an artist.

41
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:07,303
He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Sokol.

42
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,413
What is the chief element he employs?

43
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:16,240
There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, As if a hermit and a crucifix were within.

44
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:24,150
And here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle, And up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.

45
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:32,401
Deep into distant woodlands winds a lazy way, Reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains, Bathed in their hillside blue.

46
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:35,485
But though the picture lies thus tranced,

47
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:48,020
And though this pine-tree shakes down its size Like leaves upon this shepherd's head, Yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye Were fixed upon the magic stream before him.

48
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,082
Go visit the prairies in June.

49
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:54,367
Win for scores On scores of miles you wade knee-deep.

50
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:58,452
Among tiger-lilies what is the one charm wanting?

51
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,317
Water there is not a drop of water there.

52
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:07,127
Were New Yagua but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it?"

53
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:21,553
Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach?

54
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:26,579
Why is almost every robust, healthy boy with a robust, healthy soul in him?

55
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,682
Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?

56
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:34,548
Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, an own brother of Chove?

57
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:49,566
Surely all this is not without meaning, and still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who, because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned.

58
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:54,971
but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.

59
00:05:55,192 --> 00:06:01,103
It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life, and this is the key to it all.

60
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:11,284
Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea, whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over-conscious of my lungs,

61
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:23,683
I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger, for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.

62
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:30,493
Besides, passengers get seasick, grow quarrelsome, don't sleep of nights, do not enjoy themselves much.

63
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:40,107
As a general thing, no, I never go as a passenger, nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a commodore.

64
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:41,829
or a captain, or a cook.

65
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,435
I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them.

66
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:54,725
For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever.

67
00:06:55,446 --> 00:07:04,457
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself without taking care of ships, barquets, brigs, schooners, and what not.

68
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:06,641
and as for going is cook.

69
00:07:07,603 --> 00:07:22,390
Though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on shipboard yet, somehow I never fancied broiling fowls though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgematically salted and peppered.

70
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:25,956
There is no one who will speak more respectfully

71
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:29,743
not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.

72
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:43,067
It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river-horse that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses, the pyramids,

73
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:49,837
No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumbed down into the fore.

74
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:52,380
And at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough.

75
00:07:52,881 --> 00:08:04,458
It touches one's sense of honour, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardy Canutes.

76
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:12,970
And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster.

77
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,398
making the tallest boy stand in awe of you.

78
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:28,206
The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.

79
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:30,992
But even this wears off in time.

80
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:31,633
What of it?

81
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:44,369
If some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks, what does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?

82
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:53,520
Do you think the Archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance?"

83
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,023
a slave.

84
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:57,606
Tell me that."

85
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:16,403
Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about, however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right, that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way either in a physical or metaphysical point of view.

86
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:26,136
That is, that in awn, so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rut each other's shoulder-blades, and to be content.

87
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:35,168
Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of.

88
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:45,572
On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay, and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid.

89
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:53,103
The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us.

90
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:57,088
But being paid, what will compare with it?

91
00:09:57,254 --> 00:10:11,297
The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a moneyed man enter heaven.

92
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,165
Ah, how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!

93
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:23,415
Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck.

94
00:10:24,176 --> 00:10:33,750
For, as in this world, headwinds are far more prevalent than winds, from astern, that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim.

95
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:41,942
So, for the most part, the commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle.

96
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,996
He thinks he breathes it first, but not so.

97
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:54,970
In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.

98
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:04,605
But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant-sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage.

99
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:19,219
This the invisible police officer of the fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way, he can better answer than any one else.

100
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,168
And, doubtless, my going on this wailing voyage

101
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:28,016
formed part of the grand program of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago.

102
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:34,727
It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances.

103
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:44,683
I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this kind, contested election, for the Presidency of the United States.

104
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,628
Wailing Voyage by one Ishmael.

105
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:49,013
Bloody battle in Afghanistan.

106
00:11:49,254 --> 00:12:03,027
Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage-managers, the fates, put me down for this shabby part of a wailing voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies,

107
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:07,194
and jolly parts in farces, though I cannot tell why this was exactly our heat.

108
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:19,215
Now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which, being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling."

109
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:23,783
Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself.

110
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:29,371
Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.

111
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:45,110
Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk, the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale, these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.

112
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,915
With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements.

113
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:54,462
But as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote.

114
00:12:54,442 --> 00:13:01,333
I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts, not ignoring what is good.

115
00:13:01,974 --> 00:13:14,593
I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it, would they let me since it is, but well to be, on friendly terms, with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.

116
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:38,640
By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome, the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, to and to there floated into my inmost soul endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow-hill in the air.
