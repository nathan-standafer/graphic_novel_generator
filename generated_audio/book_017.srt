1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:08,316
Book II's Telemachus and his mother meet Ulysses and Eumaeus come down to the town and Ulysses is insulted by Melantheus.

2
00:00:08,938 --> 00:00:11,526
He is recognized by the dog Argos.

3
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:14,869
He is insulted and presently struck by antiness with a stool.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,053
Penelope desires that he shall be sent to hair.

5
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:30,672
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that Silamachus bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for his mother meet Ulysses's.

6
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:34,037
Old friend, said he to the swineherd.

7
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:39,731
I will now go to the town and show myself to my mother, for she will never leave off grieving till she has seen me.

8
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:46,747
As for this unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let him beg there of anyone who will give him a drink and a piece of bread.

9
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:50,777
I have trouble enough of my own and cannot be burdened with other people.

10
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:54,975
If this makes him angry, so much the worse for him, but I like to say what I mean."

11
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:58,581
Then Ulysses said, "'Sir, I do not want to stay here.

12
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:03,310
A beggar can always do better in town than country, for anyone who likes can give him something.

13
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,317
I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck and call of a master.

14
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:15,972
Therefore let this man do as you have just told him, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire and the day has got a little heat in it.

15
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:22,921
My clothes are wretchedly thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you say the city is some way off."

16
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:27,186
On this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge upon the suitors.

17
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:35,157
When he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself, and went inside.

18
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:39,242
Nurse Eurycleia saw him long before anyone else did.

19
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:43,549
She was putting the fleeces onto the seats and she burst out crying as she ran up to him.

20
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,896
All the other maids came up too and covered his head and shoulders with their kisses.

21
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:54,005
Penelope came out of her room looking like Diana or Venus and wept as she flung her arms about her son.

22
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:57,290
She kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes.

23
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,856
Light of my eyes, she cried as she spoke fondly to him.

24
00:02:01,276 --> 00:02:05,483
So you are come home again, I made sure I was never going to see you anymore.

25
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:10,369
to think of your having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it, or obtaining my consent.

26
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,373
But come, tell me what you saw."

27
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:15,516
"'Do not scold me, mother,' answered Telemachus.

28
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,319
"'Nor vex me, seeing what a narrow escape I have had.

29
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:28,332
But wash your face, change your dress, go upstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors.'"

30
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:33,376
I must now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has come back with me from Pylos.

31
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:39,141
I sent him on with my crew and told Piraeus to take him home and look after him till I could come for him myself."

32
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:50,271
She heeded her son's words, washed her face, changed her dress, and vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would only vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.

33
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:58,318
Telemachus went through, and out of, the cloister's spear in hand, not alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him.

34
00:02:58,298 --> 00:03:07,952
Minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marveled at him as he went by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths and malice in their hearts.

35
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:16,724
But he avoided them, and went to sit with Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of his father's house, and they made him tell them all that had happened to him.

36
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:25,757
Then Piraeus came up with Theoclymanus, whom he had escorted through the town to the place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once joined them.

37
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:27,240
Piraeus was first to speak.

38
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:33,933
"'Telemachus,' said he, "'I wish you would send some of your women to my house to take away the presents Menelaus gave you.'

39
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:37,841
"'We do not know, Piraeus,' answered Telemachus, "'what may happen.

40
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:42,210
If the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,

41
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,295
I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people should get hold of them.

42
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:52,644
If, on the other hand, I manage to kill them, I shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents."

43
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:55,468
With these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house.

44
00:03:55,988 --> 00:04:01,836
When they got there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into the baths and washed themselves.

45
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:06,990
When the maids had washed and anointed them and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats at table.

46
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:16,838
A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them.

47
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:21,084
an upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.

48
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:26,873
Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the bearing posts of the cloister and spinning.

49
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:42,977
Then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Penelope said, Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which I have not ceased to wash it with my tears, from the day Ulysses set out for Troy with the sons of Atreus.

50
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:50,588
You failed, however, to make it clear to me before the suitors came back to the house whether or no you had been able to hear anything about the return of your father.

51
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:53,212
I will tell you then, truth," replied her son.

52
00:04:53,632 --> 00:05:01,984
We went to Pylos and saw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long absence.

53
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:03,987
So also did his sons,

54
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:09,014
But he said he had not heard a word from any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead.

55
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:12,799
He sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus.

56
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,508
There I saw Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in heaven's wisdom doomed to suffer.

57
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:30,042
Menelaus asked me what it was that had brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth, whereon he said, So then, these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed,

58
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:36,892
A hind might as well lay her newborn young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell.

59
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:43,722
The lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work with the pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these suitors.

60
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:46,967
By Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo.

61
00:05:46,947 --> 00:06:00,680
If Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomelides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Greeks cheered him, if he is still such, and were to come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.

62
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:09,288
As regards your question, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much will I tell you in full.

63
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:15,013
He said he could see Ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso,

64
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:20,880
who was keeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.

65
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:29,329
This was what Menelaus told me, and when I had heard his story I came away, the gods then gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.

66
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:32,974
With these words he moved the heart of Penelope.

67
00:06:33,474 --> 00:06:40,242
Then Theoclemenus said to her, Madam, wife of Eudeses, Telemachus does not understand these things.

68
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:44,570
Listen, therefore, to me, for I can divine them surely, and will hide nothing from you.

69
00:06:45,472 --> 00:07:03,765
May Jove the King of heaven be my witness, and the rites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come, that Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about the country or staying in one place, is inquiring into all these evil deeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors.

70
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:08,335
I saw an omen when I was on the ship, which meant this, and I told Telemachus about it."

71
00:07:09,036 --> 00:07:11,301
"'May it be even so,' answered Penelope.

72
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:17,814
"'If your words come true, you shall have such gifts and such goodwill from me that all who see you shall congratulate you.'

73
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,999
Thus did they converse."

74
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:28,472
Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs, or aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the house, and behaving with all their old insolence.

75
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:46,881
But when it was now time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come into the town from all the country round, one forty with their shepherds as usual, then Medon, who was their favourite servant and who waited upon them at table, said, Now then, my young masters, you have had enough sport, so come inside that we may get dinner ready.

76
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:49,205
Dinner is not a bad thing at dinnertime."

77
00:07:49,726 --> 00:08:01,204
They left their sports as he told them, and when they were within the house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat and well-grown one for one.

78
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:03,688
Thus they made ready for their meal.

79
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:14,705
In the meantime, Ulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and the swineherd said, Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to town today, as my master said you were to do.

80
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:25,221
For my own part, I should have liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my master tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from one's master is a very serious thing.

81
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:27,724
Let us then be off, for it is now broad day.

82
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:30,988
It will be night again directly, and then you will find it colder."

83
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,009
14202.

84
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,133
I know and understand you, replied Ulysses.

85
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:36,295
You need say no more.

86
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:42,763
Let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it to walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.

87
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:50,432
As he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders, by the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his liking.

88
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:55,320
The two then started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs and herdsmen who remained behind.

89
00:08:55,981 --> 00:09:04,093
The swineherd led the way, and his master followed after, looking like some broken-down old tramp as he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags.

90
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:10,643
When they had got over the rough, steep ground and were nearing the city, they reached the fountain from which the citizens drew their water.

91
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:14,529
This had been made by Ithicus, Naritas, and Poliktor.

92
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,816
There was a grove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it,

93
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:28,029
and the clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, 143, while above the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers used to sacrifice.

94
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:37,463
Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as he was driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitor's dinner, and there were two shepherds with him.

95
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:43,871
When he saw Eumaeus and Ulysses, he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language, which made Ulysses very angry.

96
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:47,136
There you go, cried he, and a precious pair you are.

97
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:50,079
See how heaven brings birds of the same feather to one another.

98
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,665
Where, pray Master Swineherd, are you taking this poor, miserable object?

99
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,911
It would make anyone sick to see such a creature at table.

100
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:12,208
A fellow like this never won a prize for anything in his life, but will go about rubbing his shoulders against every man's doorpost, and begging not for swords and cauldrons forty-four like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth begging for.

101
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:22,215
If ye would give him to me for a hand on my station, he might do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on way.

102
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:25,959
But he is taken to bad ways, and will not go about any kind of work.

103
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,745
He will do nothing but beg vituals all the town over, to feed his insatiable belly.

104
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:40,457
I say therefore, and it shall surely be, if he goes near Ulysses' house he will get his head broken by the stools they will fling at him, till they turn him out.

105
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:48,045
On this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure wantonness, but Ulysses stood firm and did not budge from the path.

106
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:55,533
For a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill him with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains out.

107
00:10:55,933 --> 00:11:05,483
He resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but the swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting up his hands and praying to heaven as he did so.

108
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:15,404
"'Fountain-nymphs,' he cried, "'children of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned you thigh-bones, covered with fat, whether of lambs or kids, grant my prayer that heaven may send him home.

109
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:25,446
He would soon put an end to the swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting people, gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin through bad shepherding.

110
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:30,315
Then Melanthius the Goatherd answered, You ill-conditioned cur, what are you talking about?

111
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:37,207
Some day or other I will put you on board ship and take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket the money you will fetch.

112
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:46,945
I wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill him, as I am that Ulysses will never come home again.

113
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:52,755
With this he left them to come on at their leisure while he went quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master.

114
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:59,267
When he got there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite Eurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others.

115
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:05,558
The servants brought him a portion of meat and an upper woman servant set bread before him that he might eat.

116
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:13,582
Presently Ulysses and the swineherd came up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemius was just beginning to sing to the suitors.

117
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:24,441
Then Ulysses took hold of the swineherd's hand, and said, Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place, no matter how far you go you will find few like it.

118
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:26,785
One building keeps following on after another.

119
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,691
The outer court has a wall with battlements all round it.

120
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:35,161
The doors are double folding, and of good workmanship, it would be a hard matter to take it by force of arms.

121
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:46,041
I perceive, too, that there are many people banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods have made to go along with feasting.

122
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:53,353
Then Eumaeus said, You have perceived a right, as indeed you generally do, but let us think what will be our best course.

123
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:57,560
Will you go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you?

124
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:00,305
Or will you wait here and let me go in first?

125
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:05,634
But do not wait long, or someone may see you loitering about outside and throw something at you.

126
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:08,198
Consider this matter, I pray you.

127
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:10,963
And Ulysses answered, I understand and heed.

128
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:13,407
Go in first and leave me here where I am.

129
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:16,812
I am quite used to being beaten and having things thrown at me.

130
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:23,503
I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that I am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest.

131
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:26,996
But a man cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly.

132
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:30,100
This is an enemy which gives much trouble to all men.

133
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,867
It is because of this that ships are fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war upon other people."

134
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:41,454
As they were thus talking, a dove that had been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up his ears.

135
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:48,242
This was Argos, whom Ulysses had bred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of him.

136
00:13:48,222 --> 00:14:04,903
In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went hunting wild goats or deer or hares, but now that his master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to manure the great clothes, and he was full of fleas.

137
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:12,373
As soon as he saw Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears and wanged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master.

138
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:22,871
When Ulysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, he dashed a tear from his eyes, without Eumaeus seeing it, and said, Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is, over yonder on the manure heap.

139
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:24,414
His build is splendid.

140
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:31,406
Is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only one of those dogs that come baking about a table, and are kept merely for show?

141
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:36,775
This hound, answered Eumaeus, belonged to him who has died in a far country.

142
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:41,419
If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would soon show you what he could do.

143
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:46,307
There was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks.

144
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:52,598
But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of him.

145
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:56,805
Servants never do their work when their master's hand is no longer over them.

146
00:14:57,072 --> 00:15:00,339
for Jove takes half the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.

147
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:07,555
As he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the suitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognized his master.

148
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:13,748
Telemachus saw Eumaeus long before anyone else did, and beckoned him to come and sit beside him.

149
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:18,757
So he looked about and saw a seat lying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the suitors.

150
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:23,124
He picked it up, brought it to Telemachus' table, and sat down opposite him.

151
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:28,193
Then the servant brought him his portion and gave him bread from the bread basket.

152
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:36,110
Immediately afterwards, Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor, miserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags.

153
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:46,114
He sat down upon the threshold of ash wood just inside the doors leading from the outer to the inner court, and against a bearing post of cypress wood, which the carpenter had skillfully planed.

154
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:48,578
and had made to join truly with rule and line.

155
00:15:49,119 --> 00:16:00,659
Telemachus took a whole loaf from the bread basket, with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and said to Eumaeus, Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round of the suitors, and beg from them.

156
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,023
A beggar must not be shamefaced.

157
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:13,759
So Eumaeus went up to him and said, Stranger, Telemachus sends you this and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for beggars must not be shamefaced.

158
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:20,749
Ulysses answered, May King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus and fulfill the desire of his heart.

159
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:27,319
Then with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him and laid it on the dirty old wallet at his feet.

160
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,128
He went on eating it while the bard was singing and had just finished his dinner as he left off.

161
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:47,767
The suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors, that he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good from the bad, but come what might, she was not going to save a single one of them.

162
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:55,521
Ulysses therefore went on his round, going from left to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real beggar.

163
00:16:55,703 --> 00:17:08,073
Some of them pitied him and were curious about him, asking one another who he was and where he came from, whereon the goat-herd Melanthius said, "'Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I have seen him before.'

164
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:14,067
The swine-herd brought him here, but I know nothing about the man himself, nor where he comes from."

165
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:16,650
On this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd.

166
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:21,036
You precious idiot, he cried, what have you brought this man to town for?

167
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:25,061
Have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?

168
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:29,767
Do you think it a small thing that such people gather here to waste your master's property?

169
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:31,990
And must you needs bring this man as well?

170
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:36,877
And Eumaeus answered, Antinous, your birth is good, but your word's evil.

171
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,480
It was no doing of mine that he came here.

172
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:50,292
who is likely to invite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who can do public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a bard who can charm us with his singing.

173
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:56,759
Such men are welcome all the world over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him.

174
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:07,290
You are always harder on Ulysses' servants than any of the other suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as Telemachus and Penelope are alive and here.

175
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:10,510
But Telemachus said, Hush, do not answer him.

176
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:14,759
Antinous has the bitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.

177
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:20,713
Then turning to Antinous, he said, Antinous, you take as much care of my interests as though I were your son.

178
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:24,942
Why should you want to see this stranger turned out of the house?

179
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:29,714
Heaven forbid, take something and giveth him yourself, I do not grudge it, I bid you take it.

180
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:40,382
Never mind my mother, nor any of the other servants in the house, but I know you will not do what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself than of giving them to other people.

181
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:42,165
What do you mean, Telemachus?"

182
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:44,788
replied Antinous, by this swaggering talk.

183
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:50,636
If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will, he would not come here again for another three months.

184
00:18:51,317 --> 00:19:02,131
As he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from under the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet with bread and meat.

185
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:06,657
He was about, therefore, to go back to the threshold and eat what the suitors had given him.

186
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:10,247
But he first went up to Antinous and said, Sir, give me something.

187
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,332
You are not surely the poorest man here.

188
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:14,979
You seem to be a chief, foremost among them all.

189
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,110
Therefore you should be the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty.

190
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:22,534
I too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own.

191
00:19:23,014 --> 00:19:28,282
In those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be, nor what he wanted.

192
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:36,335
I had any number of servants, and all the other things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from me.

193
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,179
He sent me with a band of roving robbers to Egypt.

194
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,364
It was a long voyage, and I was undone by it.

195
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:50,456
I stationed my ships in the river Egyptus and bade my men stay by them and keep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.

196
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:58,968
But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men and taking their wives and children captives.

197
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:09,263
The alarm was soon carried to the city, and when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the plain was filled with soldiers' horse and foot and with the gleam of armour.

198
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:15,351
Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded.

199
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:20,398
The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced labor for them.

200
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:28,750
As for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them, to take to Cyprus, Demeter by name, son of Iasis, who was a great man in Cyprus.

201
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:32,415
Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery,

202
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:37,663
Then Antinous said, What God can absent such a pestilence to plague us during our dinner?

203
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:46,075
Get out into the open part of the court, one forty-five, or I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and importunity.

204
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:55,348
You have begged of all the others, and they have given you lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to be free with other people's property when there is plenty of it.

205
00:20:55,328 --> 00:21:01,242
On this Ulysses began to move off, and said, Your looks, my fine sir, are better than your breeding.

206
00:21:01,463 --> 00:21:05,372
If you were in your own house you would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt.

207
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:12,088
For though you are in another man's, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you to give him even a piece of bread.

208
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:25,018
This made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him, saying, You shall pay for this before you... Ulysses stood firm as a rock, and the blow did not even stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his revenge.

209
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,651
Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there, laying his well-filled wallet at his feet.

210
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:35,800
"'Listen to me,' he cried, "'you suitors of Queen Penelope, "'that I may speak even as I am minded.

211
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:48,623
"'A man knows neither ache nor pain "'if he gets hit while fighting for his money, "'or for his sheep or his cattle, "'and even so antinouses hit me "'while in the service of my miserable belly, "'which is always getting people into trouble.'"

212
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:55,617
Still, if the poor have gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may come to a bad end before his marriage.

213
00:21:56,138 --> 00:22:00,747
Sit where you are and eat your victuals in silence or be off elsewhere, shouted Antinous.

214
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:07,641
If you say more, I will have you dragged hand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you alive.

215
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:14,693
The other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young men said, Antinus, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a tramp.

216
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,858
It will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some god.

217
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:26,513
And we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people from foreign countries and travel about the world to see who do amiss and who righteously.

218
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:27,775
146.

219
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:32,363
Thus said the suitors, but Antinus paid them no heed.

220
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:41,134
Meanwhile, Telemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to his father, and though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence and brooded on his revenge.

221
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:49,044
Now, when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the banqueting cloister, she said before her maids, Would that Apollo would so strike you, Antinous!

222
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:56,173
And her waiting woman, Euryneme, answered, If our prayers were answered, not one of the suitors would ever again see the sunrise.

223
00:22:56,153 --> 00:23:05,675
Then Penelope said, Nurse 11147, I hate every single one of them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate Antinous like the darkness of death itself.

224
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:10,045
A poor unfortunate tramp has come begging about the house for sheer want.

225
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:16,028
Everyone else has given him something to put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him on the right shoulder blade with a footstool."

226
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:22,599
Thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in the meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner.

227
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:28,109
Then she called for the swineherd and said, "'Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come here.

228
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:31,054
I want to see him and ask him some questions.'"

229
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:35,739
He seems to have travelled much, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband."

230
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:44,590
To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, if these Achaeans, madam, would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his adventures.

231
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:54,662
I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut, which was the first place he reached after running away from his ship, and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes.

232
00:23:54,642 --> 00:24:03,413
If he had been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I sat in my hut and listened to him.

233
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:14,667
He says there is an old friendship between his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete where the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither and thither by every kind of misfortune.

234
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:23,518
He also declares that he has heard of Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the Thesprotians, and that he is bringing great wealth home with him.

235
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:27,064
Call him here then, said Penelope, that I too may hear his story.

236
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:32,914
As for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they will, for they have nothing to fret about.

237
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:47,498
Their corn and wine remain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume them, while they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen, sheep and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink.

238
00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:52,394
No estate can stand such recklessness, for we have now no Ulysses to protect us.

239
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:56,501
If he were to come again, he and his son would soon have their revenge."

240
00:24:57,342 --> 00:25:01,408
As she spoke, Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded with it.

241
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:06,736
Penelope laughed when she heard this and said to Eumaeus, "'Go and call the stranger.

242
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:10,482
Did you not hear how my son sneezed just as I was speaking?'

243
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:15,472
This can only mean that all the suitors are going to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape.

244
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:23,789
For the more I say, and lay my saying to your heart, if I am satisfied that the stranger is speaking the truth, I shall give him a shirt and cloak of good wear."

245
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:27,677
When Eumaeus heard this, he went straight to Ulysses and said,

246
00:25:27,657 --> 00:25:31,464
Father Stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for you.

247
00:25:31,804 --> 00:25:44,286
She is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very things that you are most in want of.

248
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:51,960
As for bread, you can get enough of that to fill your belly, by begging about the town and letting those give that will.

249
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,383
"'I will tell Penelope,' answered Ulysses.

250
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:56,405
"'Nothing but what is strictly true.

251
00:25:56,425 --> 00:26:05,816
I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him in affliction, but I am afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel suitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven.

252
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:15,027
Just now, moreover, as I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor anyone else defended me.

253
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:19,652
Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait till sundown.'"

254
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:23,237
Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my clothes are worn very thin.

255
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,742
You know they are, for you have seen them ever since I first asked you to help me.

256
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:29,026
She can then ask me about the return of her husband.

257
00:26:29,606 --> 00:26:36,036
The swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she saw him cross the threshold, Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus?

258
00:26:36,537 --> 00:26:41,263
Is he afraid that someone will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming inside the house at all?

259
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:43,767
Beggars should not be shamefaced.

260
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:52,286
To this you answered, O swine-herd Eumaeus, the stranger is quite reasonable, he is avoiding the suitors and is only doing what anyone else would do.

261
00:26:52,746 --> 00:27:00,979
He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much better, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when you can hear him and talk to him as you will."

262
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,223
The man is no fool," answered Penelope.

263
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:10,092
It would very likely be as he says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world as these men are.

264
00:27:10,072 --> 00:27:14,937
When she had done speaking, Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for he had explained everything.

265
00:27:15,498 --> 00:27:25,629
Then he went up to Telemachus, and said in his ear so that none could overhear him, My dear sir, I will now go back to the pigs, to see after your property and my own business.

266
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:32,777
You will look to what is going on here, but above all, be careful to keep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will.

267
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:37,142
May Jove bring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief.

268
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:44,318
"'Very well,' replied Telemachus, "'go home when you have had your dinner, "'and in the morning come here with the victims "'we are to sacrifice for the day.

269
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:47,185
"'Leave the rest to heaven, and me.'

270
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:55,344
"'On this Eumaeus took his seat again, "'and when he had finished his dinner, "'he left the courts and the cloister "'with the men at table, and went back to his pigs.

271
00:27:55,364 --> 00:28:02,961
"'As for the suitors, they presently began "'to amuse themselves with singing and dancing, "'for it was now getting on towards evening.
