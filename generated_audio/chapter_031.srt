00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:05,696
Chapter 31 - Queen Mab. Next morning Stub accosted Flask.

2
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:08,959
Such a queer dream, King Post, I never had.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,301
You know the old man's ivory leg.

4
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:19,169
Well, I dreamed he kicked me with it, and when I tried to kick back upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off.

5
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:20,490
And then, presto!

6
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:25,394
Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it.

7
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:27,797
But what was still more curious?

8
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:29,278
Flask!

9
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:31,517
You know how curious all dreams are.

10
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:41,050
Through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,613
Why, thinks I, what's the row?

12
00:00:43,673 --> 00:00:46,578
It's not a real leg, only a false leg.

13
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,843
And there's a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump.

14
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:57,713
That's what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, 50 times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.

15
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:58,654
The living member.

16
00:00:58,694 --> 00:01:01,759
That makes the living insult, my little man.

17
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:08,609
And thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid.

18
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,573
So confoundedly contradictory was it all.

19
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:17,162
All the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, what's his leg now but a cane?

20
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,465
A whalebone cane.

21
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,789
Yes, thinks I. It was only a playful cuddling.

22
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,194
In fact, only a whale-boning that he gave me, not a base kick.

23
00:01:27,975 --> 00:01:40,710
Besides, thinks I, look at it once, why, the end of it, the foot part, what a small sort of end it is, whereas, if a broad-footed farmer kicked me, there's a devilish broad insult.

24
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,454
But this insult is whittled down to a point only.

25
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,200
But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.

26
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:55,774
While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman with a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders and slews me round.

27
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:57,637
What are you about, says he.

28
00:01:57,697 --> 00:02:00,462
Slid, man, but I was frightened.

29
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:01,904
Such a fizz.

30
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:05,550
But somehow, next moment I was over the fright.

31
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,411
What am I about?"

32
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:07,532
says I at last.

33
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:11,096
And what business is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humback?

34
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:12,537
Do you want a kick?

35
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:21,627
By the Lord Flask, I had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout.

36
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:23,409
What do you think I saw?

37
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,651
Why, thunder alive, man!

38
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:29,495
His stern was stuck full of marlin spikes, with the points out.

39
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:34,761
Says I, on second thoughts, I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.

40
00:02:34,977 --> 00:02:42,910
Wise stub, said he, wise stub, and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.

41
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:51,323
Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying over his wise stub, wise stub, I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again.

42
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:56,732
But I had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out, stop that kicking.

43
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:58,412
"'Halloa,' says I.

44
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,097
"'What's the matter now, old fellow?'

45
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,163
"'Looky here,' says he.

46
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,728
"'Let's argue the insult.

47
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,854
"'Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he?'

48
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:07,920
"'Yes, he did,' says I.

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,602
"'Right.

50
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:10,367
Exire it was.'"

51
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:11,896
"'Very good,' says he.

52
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,361
"'He used his ivory leg, didn't he?'

53
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,384
"'Yes, he did,' says I.

54
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,707
"'Well then,' says he.

55
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:19,991
"'Why, Stubb, what have you to complain of?

56
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:22,215
"'Didn't he kick with right good will?

57
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,461
"'It wasn't a common pitch-pine leg he kicked with, was it?'

58
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:31,512
"'No, you were kicked by a great man, "'and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.'"

59
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:33,476
It's an honor, I consider it an honor.

60
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:35,180
Listen, wise stub.

61
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:48,066
In old England, the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garden knights of, but be your boast, stub, that ye were kicked by old Ahab and made a wise man of.

62
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:50,028
Remember what I say, B.E.

63
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:50,829
kicked by him.

64
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,956
Account his kicks honors, and on no account kick back, for you can't help yourself, wise stub.

65
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,578
Don't you see that pyramid?"

66
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:04,926
With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the air.

67
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:08,710
I snored, rolled over, and there I was in my hammock.

68
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,214
Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?

69
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:13,074
I don't know.

70
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:15,556
It seems a sort of foolish to me, though.

71
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,658
Maybe, maybe.

72
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:21,181
But it's made a wise man of me, Flask.

73
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:24,544
D'I see Ahab standing there, sideways, looking over the stern?

74
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:30,670
Well, the best thing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone, never speak to him, whatever he says.

75
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:31,811
Haloah!

76
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:32,592
What's that?

77
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:33,192
He shouts.

78
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:33,873
Hark!

79
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:34,534
Mast!

80
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,014
Head there!

81
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:36,175
Look sharp, all of ye!

82
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:37,777
There are whales hereabouts.

83
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:41,340
If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him.

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,026
What do you think of that now, Flask?

85
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:46,116
Ain't there a small drop of something queer about that, eh?

86
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:47,400
A white whale.

87
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:48,785
Did ye mark that, man?

88
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:49,548
Look ye.

89
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,374
There's something special in the wind.

90
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:53,581
Stand by for it, Flask.

91
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:54,424
Ahab has that.

92
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:55,909
That's bloody on his mind.

93
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:58,317
But mum, he comes this way.
