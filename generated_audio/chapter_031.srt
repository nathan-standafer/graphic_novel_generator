00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:06,182
CHAPTER XXXI QUEEN MAB Next morning Stub accosted Flask.

2
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:08,586
Such a queer dream, King Post, I never had.

3
00:00:09,027 --> 00:00:10,610
You know the old man's ivory leg.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:17,683
Well, I dreamed he kicked me with it, and when I tried to kick back upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off.

5
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:19,346
Then, presto!

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:24,435
Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it.

7
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:39,319
But what was still more curious—Flask, you know how curious all dreams are through all this rage that I was in—I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.

8
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:42,748
thinks I. What's the row?

9
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:46,153
It's not a real leg, only a false leg.

10
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:50,760
And there's a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump.

11
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:58,392
That's what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.

12
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:03,079
The living member that makes the living insult, my little man."

13
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:13,578
and thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid so confoundedly contradictory, was it all?

14
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,032
All the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, what's his like now but a cane a whalebone cane?

15
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:25,540
Yes, thinks I, it was only a playful cuddling in fact.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,106
Only a whale-boning that he gave me not a base kick.

17
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:41,507
Besides," thinks I, look at it once why, the end of it the foot part what a small sort of end it is, whereas, if a broad-footed farmer kicked me, there's a devilish broad insult.

18
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:45,334
But this insult is whittled down to a point only.

19
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,699
But now comes the greatest joke of the dream flask.

20
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:58,592
While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old Merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders and slews me round.

21
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:00,554
"'What are you bout?'

22
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:01,235
says he.

23
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,119
Slid, man, but I was frightened.

24
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,401
Such a fizz!

25
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:09,246
But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright.

26
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:11,309
"'What am I about?'

27
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:12,331
says I, at last.

28
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:16,397
"'And what business is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback?

29
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,400
Do you want a kick?'

30
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:28,455
"'By the Lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout.

31
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,298
What do you think I saw?

32
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,542
Why, thunder-alive man!

33
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:37,950
His stern was stuck full of marlin spikes, with the points out,' says I.

34
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,255
On second thoughts, I guess I will kick you, old fellow."

35
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:43,658
"'Wise stub,' said he.

36
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:46,362
"'Wise stub,' mince!"

37
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:51,049
kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney-hag.

38
00:02:51,170 --> 00:03:00,083
Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying over his "'Wise stub, wise stub,' I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again.

39
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:06,452
But I had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out, "'Stop that kicking!'

40
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:10,916
"'Halloa,' says I. What's the matter now, old fellow?'

41
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:12,780
"'Look ye here,' says he.

42
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:14,423
Let's argue the insult.

43
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:16,748
Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he?'

44
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:20,316
"'Yes, he did,' says I. Right here it was.'

45
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:22,801
"'Very good,' says he.

46
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,926
Used his ivory leg, didn't he?

47
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:27,090
Yes, he'd,' says I."

48
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,880
Well, then, says he, why, Stubb, what have you to complain of?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,604
Didn't he kick with right good-will?

50
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:36,253
It wasn't a common pitch-pine leg he kicked with, was it?

51
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:41,226
No, you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg.

52
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:43,712
Stubb, it's an honour."

53
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:45,295
I consider it an honour.

54
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:58,984
Listen, wise Stubb, in old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made Garter-knights of Butte be your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab.

55
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:00,526
and made a wise man of.

56
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:10,856
Remember what I say, be kicked by him, account his kicks honors, and on no account kick back, for you can't help yourself, wise stub.

57
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,758
Don't you see that pyramid?"

58
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:19,145
With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the air.

59
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:22,208
I snored rolled over, and there I was in my hammock.

60
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,872
Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?

61
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,735
I don't know, seems a sort of foolish to me, though.

62
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,086
Maybe, uh, maybe.

63
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,912
But it's made a wise man of me, Flask.

64
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:38,940
I see Ahab standing there, sideways, looking over the stern.

65
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,473
Well, the best thing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone never speak to him, whatever he says.

66
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:46,835
Halloa!

67
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:48,238
What's that he shouts?

68
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:48,799
Hark!

69
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:52,425
Mast head, there, look sharp, all of ye.

70
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,409
There are whales hereabouts.

71
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,474
If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him.

72
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,479
What do you think of that now, Flask?

73
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:03,965
Ate there a small drop of something queer about that, eh?

74
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:06,569
A white whale, did you mark that, man?

75
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,534
Look ye, there's something special in the wind.

76
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,038
Stand by for it, Flask.

77
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:14,763
Ahab has that that's bloody on his mind.

78
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:17,908
But mum, mum's this way.
