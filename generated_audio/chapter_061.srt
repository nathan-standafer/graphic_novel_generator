00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:10,063
Chapter 61 - Stub Kills a Whale. If to Starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents, to Queequeg it was quite a different object.

2
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:18,393
When you see him quid, said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat, then you quick see him palm whale.

3
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:29,447
The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to engage them, the Pequod's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacancy.

4
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:35,811
For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground.

5
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:49,231
That is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those off the Rio de la Plata or the inshore ground off Peru.

6
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:52,836
It was my turn to stand at the foremast head.

7
00:00:52,816 --> 00:01:00,149
And with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air.

8
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:05,900
No resolution could withstand it, in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness.

9
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:09,306
At last my soul went out of my body.

10
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:16,018
Though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.

11
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:32,728
Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzenmast heads were already drowsy, so that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman.

12
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:41,263
The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests, and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west and the sun over all.

13
00:01:42,024 --> 00:01:45,010
Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes.

14
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:48,116
Like vices, my hands grasped the shrouds.

15
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:51,682
Some invisible, gracious agency preserved me.

16
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:54,227
With a shock, I came back to life.

17
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:55,400
and low.

18
00:01:56,261 --> 00:02:10,427
Close under our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back of an Ethiopian hue glistening in the sun's rays like a mirror.

19
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:20,744
but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever in anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet, the whale looked like a portly burger smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon.

20
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:24,327
But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last.

21
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:37,900
As if struck by some enchanter's wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness, and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft,

22
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:45,223
shouted forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.

23
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:46,568
Clear away the boats!

24
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:47,509
Luff!"

25
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:48,130
cried Ahab.

26
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,819
And obeying his own order, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:10,806
The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale, and ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward, but with such a steady tranquility, and making so few ripples as he swam, that thinking, after all, he might not as yet be alarmed,

28
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:16,214
Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in whispers.

29
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:26,048
So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along, the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set.

30
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:36,102
Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.

31
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:46,095
There go flukes, was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by Stubbs producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was granted.

32
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:58,815
After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker's boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honor of the capture.

33
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:03,552
It was obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers.

34
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:07,199
All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.

35
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,847
Paddles were dropped and oars came loudly into play.

36
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:15,977
And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.

37
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:18,468
Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish.

38
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:25,679
All alive to his jeopardy, he was going, head out, that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed.

39
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,510
It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists.

40
00:04:33,946 --> 00:04:44,181
Though apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him, so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed.

41
00:04:44,802 --> 00:05:02,569
Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliat into a sharp-pointed New York pilot-boat.

42
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:03,306
Start her!

43
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:04,530
Start her, my men!

44
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,618
Don't hurry yourselves, take plenty of time.

45
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:14,076
But start her, start her like thunder claps, that's all," cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke.

46
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:18,347
Start her now, give him the long and strong stroke, Tashtego.

47
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:19,708
Start her, Tash, my boy.

48
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,012
Start her all, but keep cool, keep cool, keep cool.

49
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:24,553
Cucumbers is the word.

50
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:25,655
Easy, easy.

51
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:31,821
Only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves.

52
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:32,882
Boys, that's all.

53
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:33,723
Start her!

54
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:34,564
Woo-hoo!

55
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:35,525
Wahee!"

56
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:48,098
screamed the gay header in reply, raising some old war whoop to the skies, as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave.

57
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:51,667
But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild.

58
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:52,728
Keehee!

59
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:53,589
Keehee!

60
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:59,195
yelled Dagu, straining forwards and backwards on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.

61
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:00,877
Kala!

62
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:01,698
Kulu!

63
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:06,123
howled Kwekweg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of grenadier's steak.

64
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:09,928
And thus, with oars and yells, the keels cut the sea.

65
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:18,237
Meanwhile, Stubb, retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth.

66
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:22,866
Like desperadoes, they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was heard.

67
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:24,691
Stand up, Tashtego!

68
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:25,453
Give it to him!

69
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,037
The harpoon was hurled.

70
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,581
Sternal!

71
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:34,202
The oarsmen backed water, the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists.

72
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:36,085
It was the magical line.

73
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:50,130
An instant before Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circleings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe.

74
00:06:50,110 --> 00:07:07,123
As the line passed round and round the loggerhead, so also, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubbs' hands, from which the handcloths, or squares of quilted canvas, sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped.

75
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:15,495
It was like holding an enemy's sharp, two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy, all the time, striving to wrest it out of your clutch.

76
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:16,917
Wet the line!

77
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:17,919
Wet the line!

78
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:25,450
cried Stub to the tub oarsman, him seated by the tub, who, snatching off his hat, dashed seawater into it.

79
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,694
More turns were taken so that the line began holding its place.

80
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:32,698
The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.

81
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,946
Stub and Tashtego here changed places, stem for stern, a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion.

82
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:55,082
Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line with water, in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or baler, is set apart for that purpose.

83
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:57,700
Your hat, however, is the most convenient.

84
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:14,134
From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harp string, you would have thought the craft had two keels, one cleaving the water, the other the air, as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once.

85
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:28,849
A continual cascade played at the bows, a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake, and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea.

86
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:42,282
Thus they rushed, each man with might and mane clinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of Tash-to-Go at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down his center of gravity.

87
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:49,251
Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed past as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight.

88
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:50,036
"'Haul in!

89
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:50,817
Haul in!'

90
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:52,400
cried Stubb to the bowsman.

91
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:59,312
And, facing round towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet the boat was being towed on.

92
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:14,698
Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying fish, at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another fling.

93
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:18,903
The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster-like brooks down a hill.

94
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:25,872
His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake.

95
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:34,864
The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men.

96
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:57,477
And all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman, as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it, Stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.

97
00:09:58,435 --> 00:09:58,855
Pull up!

98
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,117
Pull up!"

99
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:03,901
He now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath.

100
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:04,622
Pull up!

101
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:05,483
Close to!

102
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:07,986
And the boat ranged along the fish's flank.

103
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:23,023
When reaching far over the bow, Stubbs slowly churned his long, sharp lance into the fish and kept it there, carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out.

104
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:27,868
But that gold watch, he sought, was the innermost life of the fish.

105
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:48,912
And now it is struck, for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry, the monster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray so that the imperiled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from that frenzied twilight into the clear air of the day.

106
00:10:48,892 --> 00:11:01,230
And now, abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view, surging from side to side, spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout hole with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations.

107
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:13,298
At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air, and falling back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea.

108
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:15,121
His heart had burst.

109
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,085
He's dead, Mr. Stubb, said Dagu.

110
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:20,428
Yes, both pipes smoked out.

111
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:30,002
And withdrawing his own from his mouth, Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water, and, for a moment, stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.
