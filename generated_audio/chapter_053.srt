00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:12,095
Chapter 53 - The Gam. The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this—the wind and sea betoken storms.

2
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:21,533
But even had this not been the case, he would not, after all, perhaps, have boarded her, judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions.

3
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:28,739
If so, it had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put.

4
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:41,428
For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought.

5
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:53,320
But all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas and especially on a common cruising ground.

6
00:00:53,962 --> 00:01:00,733
If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England

7
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:27,565
If casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation, and stopping for a moment to interchange the news, and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert, then, how much more natural that, upon the illimitable pine barrens and Salisbury plains of the sea, two wailing vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth,

8
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:44,912
off-loan Fanning's Island, or the far-away King's Mills, how much more natural, I say, that are, and especially would this seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to each other,

9
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:49,381
and, consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about.

10
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:54,230
For the long-absent ship, the outward bounder, perhaps, has letters on board.

11
00:01:54,691 --> 00:02:02,226
At any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files.

12
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:12,427
And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her.

13
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:22,527
And in degree, all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other's track on the cruising ground itself, even though they are equally long absent from home.

14
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:31,921
For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now far-remote vessel, and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets.

15
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:37,068
Besides, they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat.

16
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:48,345
For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and neutrally shared privations and perils.

17
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:57,361
Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference, that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case with Americans and English.

18
00:02:58,022 --> 00:03:03,752
Though, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur.

19
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:07,357
And when they do occur, there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them.

20
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:13,906
For your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself.

21
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:27,445
Besides, the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers, regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea peasant.

22
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:37,476
But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the English.

23
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:39,738
Collectively, in ten years.

24
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:50,310
But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart, probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.

25
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:56,518
So then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers have most reason to be sociable.

26
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:57,740
And they are so.

27
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:16,990
Whereas some merchant ships, crossing each other's wake in the mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in Broadway, and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon each other's rig.

28
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:30,667
As for men of war, when they chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much write-down hearty goodwill and brotherly love about it at all.

29
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:38,522
As touching slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as possible.

30
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:44,734
And as for pirates, when they chance to cross each other's crossbones, the first hail is, how many skulls?

31
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:46,518
The same way that whalers hail.

32
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,680
How many barrels?

33
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:57,540
And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides and don't like to see over much of each other's villainous likenesses.

34
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,542
But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable, free and easy whaler.

35
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:08,092
What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather?

36
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:15,107
She has a gam, a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even.

37
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:24,638
And if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubber-boilers, and such like pretty exclamations.

38
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:37,973
Why it is that all merchant seamen, and also all pirates and man-of-war's men, and slave-ship sailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale-ships, this is a question it would be hard to answer.

39
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:45,784
Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it.

40
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:51,775
It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed, but only at the gallows.

41
00:05:52,476 --> 00:06:00,130
And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude.

42
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:09,377
Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be high-lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no solid bases to stand on.

43
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:10,709
But what is a gam?

44
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,878
You might wear out your index finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word.

45
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,682
Dr. Johnson never attained to that erudition.

46
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:21,885
Noah Webster's Ark does not hold it.

47
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:29,475
Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some 15,000 true-born Yankees.

48
00:06:30,276 --> 00:06:34,422
Certainly, it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon.

49
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:37,386
With that view, let me learnedly define it.

50
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:38,908
Gam.

51
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:39,706
Noun.

52
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:43,715
A social meeting of two or more whale-ships.

53
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:59,209
Gene Raleigh on a cruising ground, when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits by boats' crews, the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other.

54
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:04,202
There is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here.

55
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:09,989
All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail, so has the whale fishery.

56
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:26,310
In a pirate, man of war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons.

57
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:39,989
But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all—high times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on casters like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs.

58
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:55,892
And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy, and therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat's steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion.

59
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:01,900
and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree.

60
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:15,472
and often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.

61
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:28,647
Nor is this any very easy matter, for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after oar reciprocating by wrapping his knees in front.

62
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:36,299
He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs.

63
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:45,673
But a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth.

64
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:49,698
merely make a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.

65
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:54,523
Then again, it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes.

66
00:08:55,104 --> 00:09:03,353
It would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself, the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands.

67
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:11,442
Indeed, as token of his entire buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands in his trousers' pockets,

68
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:16,275
But perhaps being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.

69
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:32,198
Nevertheless, there have occurred instances—well-authenticated ones, too—where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall, say, to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's hair and hold on there like grim death.
