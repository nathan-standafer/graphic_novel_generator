Chapter 12 Biographical

2
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:07,709
Queequeg was a native of Rocovoco, an isle far away to the west and south.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,591
It is not down in any map.

4
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:10,812
True places never are.

5
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:30,531
When a new-hatched savage, running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green sapling, then, then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to seize something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two.

6
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:32,653
His father was a high chief.

7
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:40,807
a king his uncle, a high priest, and on the maternal side he boasted aunts, who were the wives of unconquerable warriors.

8
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:50,223
There was excellent blood in his veins' royal stuff, though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.

9
00:00:51,224 --> 00:00:58,236
A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands.

10
00:00:58,216 --> 00:01:06,307
But the ship, having her full complement of seamen, spurned his suit, and not all the king his father's influence could prevail.

11
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:09,011
But Queequeg vowed a vow.

12
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:18,283
Alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island.

13
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:27,332
On one side was a coral reef, on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water.

14
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:48,253
Hiding his canoe, still afloat among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand, and when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he dotted out, gained her side, with one backward dash of his foot capsized, and sank his canoe, climbed up the chains,

15
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:56,031
throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.

16
00:01:56,812 --> 00:02:02,224
In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard, suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists.

17
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:07,356
Kekeweg was the son of a king, and Kekeg budged not.

18
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:17,913
struck by his desperate doglessness and his wild desire to visit Christentum, the captain at last relented, and told him he might make himself at home.

19
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:24,404
But this fine young savage, the Sea Prince of Wales, never saw the captain's cabin.

20
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:28,230
They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.

21
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:42,756
But like Tsar Peter, content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.

22
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:57,711
For at Boughton, so he told me, he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were, and more than that, still better than they were.

23
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,112
But,

24
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:09,930
The practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wickedly, infinitely more so than all his father's heathens.

25
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:17,303
Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor, and seeing what the sailors did there, and then going on to Nantucket,

26
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:23,151
and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also, poor Kwekwe gave it up for lost.

27
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:28,418
Thought he, it's a wicked world and all Meridians, all die a pagan.

28
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:38,532
Thus an old idolater at heart, he yet lived among these Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.

29
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:42,542
Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.

30
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:55,795
By hence I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.

31
00:03:55,775 --> 00:04:08,910
But, he answered, no, not yet had added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him.

32
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:15,137
But by and by, he said, he would return as soon as he felt himself baptized again.

33
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:21,985
For the Nantes, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans.

34
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,460
They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a septimel.

35
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:34,233
I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future movements.

36
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:38,202
He answered, to go to sea again, in his old location.

37
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:51,476
Upon this I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.

38
00:04:51,596 --> 00:05:08,880
He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds.

39
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:30,430
To all this I joyously assented, for, besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harponeer, and, as such, could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.

40
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:46,444
His story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.
