1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:06,363
Chapter 41 Moby Dick I, Ishmael, was one of that crew.

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,367
My shouts had gone up with the rest.

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,450
My oath had been welded with theirs.

4
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:16,001
And stronger I shouted, and more did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul.

5
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:19,828
A wild, mystical, sympathetic feeling was in me.

6
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:22,813
Ahab's quenchless feud seemed mine.

7
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:32,489
With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge.

8
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:44,348
For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the sperm-whale fishermen.

9
00:00:44,328 --> 00:01:08,412
But not all of them knew of his existence, only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him, while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him was small indeed, for, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers, the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes,

10
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:24,122
So, as seldom or never, for a whole twelve months or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sorts, the daunting length of each separate voyage, soon it was hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have encountered

11
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:37,762
at such or such a time, or on such but a meridian, a sperm-whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them.

12
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:46,515
So, minds, it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick."

13
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:56,994
Yet as of late the sperm-whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster-attacked.

14
00:01:57,614 --> 00:02:16,772
Therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby-Dick, such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the sperm-whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause.

15
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:25,343
In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.

16
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:41,983
And as for those who, previously hearing of the white whale, by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them, almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other whale of that species,

17
00:02:41,963 --> 00:03:01,940
But at length such calamities did ensue in these assaults not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations, but fatal to the last degree of fatalityâ€”those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick.

18
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:11,008
Toes, things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come.

19
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:19,404
Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters.

20
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:32,608
For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising, terrible events, as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi, but, in maritime life,

21
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:40,722
Far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.

22
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:48,977
And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life.

23
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:54,593
in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there.

24
00:03:54,874 --> 00:04:04,300
For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness, hereditary to all sailors, but of all sailors.

25
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:11,279
They are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea.

26
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:19,842
Face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them, alone,

27
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:33,785
In such remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearthstone, or ought hospitable beneath that part of the sun.

28
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:45,103
In such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing to such a calling as he does, the whale-man is wrapped by influences, all tending to make his fancy pregnant.

29
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:46,559
with many a mighty berth.

30
00:04:46,699 --> 00:05:06,332
No wonder, then, that, ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumours of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies.

31
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:12,461
which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears.

32
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:26,380
So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that few who, by those rumors at least, had heard of the white whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.

33
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:31,803
but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.

34
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:45,668
Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.

35
00:05:45,648 --> 00:06:02,053
There are those this day among them who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale, would perhaps, either from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity, decline a contest with the sperm-whale, while at any rate

36
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:15,588
There are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered the sperm-whale, but whose sole knowledge of the Leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north.

37
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:29,323
Nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great sperm-whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him, and as if the now-tested reality of his might

38
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:33,189
had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it.

39
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:50,097
We find some book-naturalists, Oleson and Pavelson, declaring the sperm-whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be a thirst for human blood.

40
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:56,888
Nor even down to so later time as Cuvieres were these, or almost similar, impressions effaced.

41
00:06:57,008 --> 00:07:17,620
For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms, that at sight of the sperm-whale, all fish, sharks included, are struck with the most lively terrors, and often in the precipitancy of their flight, dash themselves against the rocks, with such violence as to cause instantaneous death.

42
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:36,739
And, however, the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these, yet, in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povolzon, the superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.

43
00:07:36,719 --> 00:08:06,574
So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby-Dick, the earlier days of the sperm-whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long-practiced right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare, such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point Lance at such an apparition as the sperm-whale was not for mortal man.

44
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:11,746
that to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity.

45
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:17,138
On this head there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted."

46
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:24,073
Nevertheless, some there were, who, even in the face of these things, were ready to give chase to Moby Dick.

47
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:41,370
and a still greater number who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle, if offered.

48
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:56,524
One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous.

49
00:08:56,504 --> 00:09:11,003
that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time, nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability.

50
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:17,913
For us the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most erudite research.

51
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:25,583
So the hidden ways of the sperm-whale, when beneath the surface remain, in great part unaccountable to his pursuers.

52
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:41,412
and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such a vast swiftness to the most widely distant point.

53
00:09:41,392 --> 00:10:01,990
It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas.

54
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:11,078
Nor is it to be gainsayed that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults

55
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,643
could not have exceeded very many days.

56
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:27,953
Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen that the Norwest Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to the whale, so that here, in the real living experience of living men,

57
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:49,941
The prodigies related in old times of the inland Strelo Mountain in Portugal, whose start there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface, and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa Fountain near Syracuse, whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underwrung passage, a dash-dash,

58
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:54,692
The fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the vampires.

59
00:10:54,712 --> 00:11:14,317
Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these, and knowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale had escaped alive, it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions, declaring Moby-Dick not only ubiquitous but immortal, for for immortality is but ubiquity in time.

60
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:18,342
A fement of hentisthal, of spears, should be planted in his flanks.

61
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:37,393
he would still swim away unharmed under the dark salive indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blog such a sight would but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in the earthly make an incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwanted power

62
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:51,992
For it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere, thrown out a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead and a high, pyramidical white hump.

63
00:11:52,012 --> 00:12:03,347
These were his prominent features, the tokens whereby, even in the limitless uncharted seas, he revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him.

64
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:13,779
The rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale.

65
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:19,466
Ah, a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect!

66
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:29,318
When seen gliding, at high noon, through a dark blue sea, leaving a Milky Way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden gleamings,

67
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:49,127
Nor was it his unwanted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror, as that unexampled intelligent malignity which, according to specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.

68
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:55,474
More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else.

69
00:12:55,572 --> 00:13:13,716
For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn round suddenly and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship.

70
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:17,273
Already several fatalities had attended his chase.

71
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:23,643
But those similar disasters, however little brooded ashore, were by no means unusual in the fishery.

72
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:39,248
Yet, in most instances, such seemed the white whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering, or death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.

73
00:13:39,228 --> 00:14:02,822
Judged then to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal.

74
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:24,591
His three boats stove around him, and Orison men, both hurling in the eddies one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duelist at his foe, blindly seeking, with a six-inch blade, to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale, that captain was Ahab.

75
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:35,907
And then it was that, suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's leg as a mower, a blade of grass in the field.

76
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:42,816
No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Molay, could have smote him with more seeming malice.

77
00:14:42,796 --> 00:15:05,547
Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal encounter Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations.

78
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:35,500
The white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung, that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning, to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one half of the worlds, which the ancient Ophiots of the East, reverence in their statue Devil Ahab, did not fall down.

79
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:45,425
and worship it like them, but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.

80
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:50,839
All that most maddens and torments, all that stirs up the lees of things,

81
00:15:50,819 --> 00:16:06,153
all truth with malice in it, all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain, all the subtle demonisms of life and thought, all evil, to crazy Ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in Moby Dick.

82
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:14,340
He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down.

83
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:20,826
And then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it.

84
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:28,892
It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment.

85
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:45,942
Then, in darting at the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity, and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.

86
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:55,555
Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and Anguish lay stretched together in one hammock,

87
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:59,883
rounding in midwinter that dreary-howling Patagonian cape.

88
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:08,718
Then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another, and, canned so interfusing, made him mad.

89
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:13,206
That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,

90
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:29,271
that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic, and, though unlimbed of a leg, he had such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest,

91
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:38,929
and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fasts, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock.

92
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:43,497
In a straight jacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales.

93
00:17:43,527 --> 00:18:12,690
And when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun-sail spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed left behind him with the caper and swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air, and even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once again, and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone, even Ahab in his hidden self raved on.

94
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,920
Many a human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.

95
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:24,031
When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form.

96
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:30,443
Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted, like the unabated Hudson.

97
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:35,913
when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably, through the Highland gorge.

98
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:50,440
But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had been left behind, so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished.

99
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,925
that before living agent now became the living instrument.

100
00:18:54,066 --> 00:19:18,503
If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its consented canon upon its own mad marks, so that, far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousandfold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object,

101
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:35,496
This is much yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted, but vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound, winding far down from within the very heart of the spiked Hotel de Cluny, where we here stand, however grand and wonderful,

102
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:56,623
Now quit it, and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, To those vast Roman halls of Thermes, Where far beneath the fantastic towers Of man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, His whole awful essence sits in bearded state, And Gan antique beneath antiquities, Enthroned on torsos.

103
00:19:56,603 --> 00:20:06,785
So, with a broken throne, the great gods mock the captive king so like a caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages.

104
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:14,741
Wind he down there ye prouder, sadder souls, question that proud, sad king, a family likeness.

105
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:16,485
Ay, he did begetty.

106
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:22,151
He young exiled royalties, And from your grim sire only Will the old state's secret come."

107
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:25,394
Now in his heart Ahad had some glimpse of this.

108
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:30,600
Namely, Caiap, all my means are sane, My motive and my object mad.

109
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:40,971
Yet without pow'r to kill, or change, Or shun the fact, he likewise knew That to mankind he did long dissemble, In some sort did still.

110
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:47,263
But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.

111
00:20:47,504 --> 00:21:00,208
Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved.

112
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:22,483
And that to the quake, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him, the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause, and so too all the added moodiness which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow.

113
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:48,049
Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbour the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales.

114
00:21:48,029 --> 00:22:09,700
Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea such in one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes, or, if for any reason thought to be corporarily incapacitated for that,

115
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:16,795
Yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack.

116
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:28,937
But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage

117
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:33,883
with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting, the white whale.

118
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:47,400
Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man.

119
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,608
They were bent on profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from lament.

120
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:58,874
He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.

121
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:06,822
Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing, with curses, a job's whale round the world.

122
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:20,777
At the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck,

123
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:27,489
the invulnerable jolity of indifference and recklessness and stub, and the pervading mediocrity and flask.

124
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:36,285
Such a crew, so officer'd, seemed especially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge.

125
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:49,350
How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man's ire by what evil magic their souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs, the white whale as much their insufferable foe as his!

126
00:23:50,091 --> 00:24:06,255
How all this came to be what the white whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seen the gliding great demon of the seas of life, all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can

127
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:14,975
a subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever-shifting, muffled sound of his pick?

128
00:24:15,717 --> 00:24:18,824
Who does not feel the irresistible arm-drag?

129
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:22,593
What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still?

130
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:35,382
For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place, but while yet all a rush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.
