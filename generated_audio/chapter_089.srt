00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:15,667
Chapter 89 - Fast Fish and Loose Fish. The allusion to the waif and waif poles in the last chapter but one necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.

2
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:30,240
It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and captured by another vessel, and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies

3
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,725
all partaking of this one grand feature.

4
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:51,942
For example, after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm, and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line.

5
00:00:51,922 --> 00:01:02,778
Thus, the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all cases.

6
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,187
Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment was that of Holland.

7
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,973
It was decreed by the States General in A.D.

8
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:14,655
1695.

9
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:23,818
But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter.

10
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:34,552
They have provided a system which, for terse comprehensiveness, surpasses Justinian's Pandex and the bylaws of the Chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people's business.

11
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:42,801
Yes, these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne's fourthing or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck, so small are they.

12
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:46,245
Aye, a fast fish belongs to the party fast to it.

13
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:49,030
2.

14
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,100
A loose, fish-is-fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.

15
00:01:53,702 --> 00:02:01,422
But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it.

16
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:04,470
First, what is a fast fish?

17
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:14,435
Alive or dead a fish is technically fast when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants.

18
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:20,029
A mast, an oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb

19
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,092
it is all the same.

20
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:36,027
Likewise, a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any other recognized symbol of possession, so long as the party waifing it plainly evinces their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as their intention so to do.

21
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:43,589
These are scientific commentaries, but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks.

22
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,232
The Kokopon Littleton of the Fist.

23
00:02:46,893 --> 00:03:01,187
True, among the more upright and honorable whalemen, allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party.

24
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:03,879
But others are by no means so scrupulous.

25
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:08,747
Some 50 years ago, there was a curious case of whale trouver litigated in England.

26
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:24,458
wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern seas, and when indeed they, the plaintiffs, had succeeded in harpooning the fish, they were at last, through peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat itself.

27
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:36,152
Ultimately, the defendants, the crew of another ship, came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs.

28
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:51,719
And when those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiff's teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure.

29
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:58,832
Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.

30
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:02,957
Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants, Lord Ellenborough was the judge.

31
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:09,326
In the course of the defense the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim.

32
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:10,447
Con.

33
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:26,068
Case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life, but in the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of her.

34
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:52,714
Erskine was on the other side, and he then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her, yet abandoned her he did, so that she became a loose fish, and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her.

35
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:59,007
Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.

36
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:14,297
These pleadings and the counter-pleadings being duly heard, the very learned judge in set terms decided, to wit, that, as for the boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives.

37
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:35,593
but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants, the whale, because it was a loose fish at the time of the final capture, and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them, it, the fish, acquired a property in those articles, and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them.

38
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:38,354
Now the defendants afterwards took the fish.

39
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:41,144
Ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.

40
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:47,187
A common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly object to it.

41
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:59,316
but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above-cited case.

42
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:08,888
These two laws touching fast fish and loose fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence.

43
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:17,468
For notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.

44
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:25,527
Is it not a saying in everyone's mouth, possession is half of the law, that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession?

45
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:28,539
But often possession is the whole of the law.

46
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,247
What are the sinews and soles of Russian serfs and Republican slaves?

47
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:37,093
But fast fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law.

48
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:41,821
What to the rapacious landlord is the widow's last mite but a fast fish?

49
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:47,190
What is yonder undetected villain's marble mansion with a doorplate for a waif?

50
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:50,215
What is that but a fast fish?

51
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:59,894
What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor Wobegon, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Wobegon's family from starvation?

52
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:03,538
What is that ruinous discount but a fast fish?

53
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:16,354
What is the Archbishop of Savesoul's income of L100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers, all sure of heaven without any of Savesoul's help?

54
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:19,859
What is that globular L100,000 but a fast fish?

55
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,506
What are the Duke of Dunder's hereditary towns and hamlets but fast fish?

56
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:30,195
What to that redoubted harpooner John Bull is poor Ireland but a fast fish?

57
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:35,422
What to that apostolic lancer Brother Jonathan is Texas but a fast fish?

58
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:40,570
And concerning all these, is not possession the whole of the law?

59
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:47,958
But if the doctrine of fast fish be pretty generally applicable, the kindred doctrine of loose fish is still more widely so.

60
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:51,741
That is internationally and universally applicable.

61
00:07:52,602 --> 00:08:01,551
What was America in 1492 but a loose fish, in which Columbus struck the Spanish Standard by way of wafing it for his royal master and mistress?

62
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:03,954
What was Poland to the Tsar?

63
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:05,676
What Greece to the Turk?

64
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,958
What India to England?

65
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:11,143
What at last will Mexico be to the United States?

66
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:13,026
All loose fish.

67
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:17,533
What are the rights of man and the liberties of the world but loose fish?

68
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:21,259
What all men's minds and opinions but loose fish?

69
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:25,266
What is the principle of religious belief in them but a loose fish?

70
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:31,216
What to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but loose fish?

71
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:35,262
What is the great globe itself but a loose fish?

72
00:08:35,377 --> 00:08:39,244
And what are you, reader, but a loose fish and a fast fish too?
