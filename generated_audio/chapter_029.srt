CHAPTER XXIX.

2
00:00:01,915 --> 00:00:03,778
ENTER AHAB TO HIM, STUB.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,605
Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern.

4
00:00:08,126 --> 00:00:17,263
The Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quido Spring, which at sea almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic.

5
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:28,958
The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing Redundant days, whereas crystal goblets Of Persian sherbet, heaped up, flaked up With rose-water snow.

6
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:41,715
The starred and stately nights Seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, Nursing at home in lonely pride The memory of their absent conquering earls, The golden-helmeted suns.

7
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:48,244
For sleeping man, t'was hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights.

8
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:56,315
But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world.

9
00:00:56,636 --> 00:01:02,183
Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on.

10
00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:09,053
Then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights.

11
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:14,080
And all these subtle agencies, more and more they rot on Ahab's texture.

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:22,711
Old age is always wakeful, as if the longer linked with life, the less man has to do with ort that looks like death.

13
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:30,602
Among sea commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked decks.

14
00:01:30,582 --> 00:01:43,183
It was so with Ahab only that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that, truly speaking, his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks.

15
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:55,965
"'It feels like going down into one's tomb,' he would mutter to himself, for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug

16
00:01:55,945 --> 00:02:25,345
So almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were set, and the band on deck sentineled the slumbers of the band below, and when, if a roak was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropped it to its place, for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates, when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabin scuttle, and, nay, lull the old man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister,

17
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:45,983
Some considering touch of humanity was in him, for at times like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck, because to his wearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step.

18
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:49,669
that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks.

19
00:02:50,250 --> 00:03:01,828
But once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings, and, as with heavy lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from tafrail to mainmast, stub, the old second mate, came up from below,

20
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:20,402
with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay, nay, but, there might be some way of muffling the noise, hinting, something indistinctly and hesitatingly, about a globe of toe, and the insertion into it of the ivory heel.

21
00:03:20,422 --> 00:03:21,063
Ah, stub!

22
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:24,289
Thou didst not know Ahab then.

23
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,961
Am I a cannon-ball, stub, said Ahab, That thou wouldst ward me that fashion?

24
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:40,050
But go thy ways, I forgot, Below to thy nightly grave, Where such as ye sleep between shrouds, To use ye to the filling one at last, Down dog and kennel.

25
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:50,825
Starting at the unforeseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment, then said excitedly, I am not used to be spoken to that way.

26
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:53,568
Sir, do but less than half like it, sir.

27
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,411
Avast!

28
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:59,997
gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,

29
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:02,603
As if to avoid some passionate temptation.

30
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:06,552
No, sir, not yet," said Stub and Boldon.

31
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:09,318
I will not tamely be called a dog, sir.

32
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:16,534
Then be called ten times a donkey, And a mule, and an ass, and be gone, Or I'll clear the world of thee.

33
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:24,977
As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect that Stubb involuntarily retreated.

34
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:33,646
"'I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,' muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin scuttle.

35
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,808
"'It's very queer.

36
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,830
Stop Stubb somehow, now.

37
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:45,137
I don't well know whether to go back and strike him, or what's that, down here on my knees and pray for him?'

38
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:47,946
Yes, that was the thought coming up in me.

39
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:51,732
But it would be the first time I ever did pray.

40
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:55,577
It's queer, very queer, and he's queer too, aye.

41
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:57,219
Take him for an aft.

42
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,103
He's about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with.

43
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:02,006
How he flashed at me!

44
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:04,149
His eyes like powder pans.

45
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:05,230
Is he mad?

46
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:12,120
Anyway, there's something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks.

47
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,728
He ain't in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the twenty-four.

48
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,092
And he don't sleep, then.

49
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:40,521
Didn't that dough-boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's hammock-clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot, and the cover-lid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it?

50
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:41,863
A hot old man.

51
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,948
I guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience.

52
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:50,134
It's a kind of tick-dolly road, they say, worse, nor a toothache.

53
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:55,501
Well, well, well, I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it.

54
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:59,927
He's full of riddles, I wonder, what he goes into the after-hold for.

55
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:05,173
Every night, as Doughboy tells me he suspects, What's that for?

56
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:06,414
I should like to know.

57
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:09,517
Who's made appointments with him in the hold?

58
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:11,159
Ain't that queer now?

59
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,681
But there's no telling.

60
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:16,025
It's the old game here goes for a snooze.

61
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:23,753
Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while To be born into the world, if only to fall right asleep.

62
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:25,695
And now that I think of it,

63
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,597
That's about the first thing babies do.

64
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,019
And that's a sort of queer, too.

65
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,222
Damn me, but all things are queer.

66
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:35,645
Come to think of M. But that's against my principles.

67
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:36,826
Think not.

68
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,969
Is my eleventh commandment men sleep when you can?

69
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,993
Is my twelfth, so here goes again.

70
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,334
But how's that?

71
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:46,056
Didn't he call me a dog?

72
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:53,303
Blazes, he called me ten times a donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that.

73
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:56,588
He might as well have kicked me, and done with it.

74
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,832
Maybe he did kick me, and I didn't observe it.

75
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:02,917
I was so taken all aback with his brows somehow.

76
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,621
It flashed like a bleached bone.

77
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:07,243
What the devil's the matter with me?

78
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:09,527
I don't stand right on my legs.

79
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:14,193
Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out.

80
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:20,202
By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though how, how, how?

81
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,557
but the only way is to stash it.

82
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:29,955
So here goes the hammock again, and in the morning, I'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over a daylight.
