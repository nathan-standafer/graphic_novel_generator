1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,653
Bookextherynx, the visit to the dead eight-eight.

2
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:09,019
Then, when we had got down to the seashore, we drew our ship into the water and got her mast and sails into her.

3
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:14,064
We also put the sheep on board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind.

4
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:23,072
Circe, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and stayed steadily with us, keeping our sails all the time well filled.

5
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:29,177
So we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear, and let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her.

6
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:32,723
All day long her sails were full, as she held her course over the sea.

7
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:48,607
But when the sun went down and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep waters of the river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce, neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens.

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:52,313
But the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night.

9
00:00:52,293 --> 00:01:00,709
When we got there, we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till we came to the place of which Circe had told us.

10
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:07,562
Here, Peramedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword and dug the trench a cubit each way.

11
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:14,335
I made a drink offering to all the dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water,

12
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:28,071
and I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I got back to Ithaca, I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best I had, and would load the pyre with good things.

13
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:32,998
I also particularly promised that Tiresias should have a black sheep to himself,

14
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:34,861
the best in all my flocks.

15
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:44,136
When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench, whereon the ghosts came trooping up from Erebus brides.

16
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:54,193
Eighty-nine young bachelors, old men worn out with toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been killed in battle, with their armour still smerched with blood,

17
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:59,942
They came from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with fear.

18
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:10,039
When I saw them coming, I told the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine.

19
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:18,392
But I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless ghosts come near the blood till Teresia should have answered my questions.

20
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:23,917
The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had not yet been laid beneath the earth.

21
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:29,502
We had left his body unwaked and unburied in Cersei's house, for we had had too much else to do.

22
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:32,545
I was very sorry for him and cried when I saw him.

23
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,829
Elpenor, said I, how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness?

24
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,112
You have got here on foot quicker than I have with my ship.

25
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,855
Sir, he answered with a groan.

26
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:47,299
It was all bad luck and my own unspeakable drunkenness.

27
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:58,237
I was lying asleep on the top of Circe's house, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase, but fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul came down to the house of Hades.

28
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:06,891
And now I beseech you by all those whom you have left behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father who brought you up when you were a child,

29
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:11,235
and by Telemachus, who is the one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you.

30
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:16,539
I know that when you leave this limbo, you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean island.

31
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:24,847
Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or I may bring heaven's anger upon you, but burn me with whatever armour I have.

32
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:36,777
Build a barrel for me on the seashore, that may tell people in days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave the oar I used to row with when I was yet alive, and with my messmates.

33
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:40,522
And I said, My poor fellow, I will do all that you have asked of me.

34
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:51,356
Thus then did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the one side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side.

35
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:55,922
Then came the ghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolychus.

36
00:03:56,643 --> 00:04:01,009
I had left her alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears when I saw her.

37
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:07,178
But even so, for all my sorrow, I would not let her come near the blood till I had asked my questions of Teresias.

38
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:12,686
Then came also the ghost of Theban Teresias, with his golden scepter in his hand.

39
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:22,360
He knew me and said, Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit the dead in this sad place?

40
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:29,410
Stand back from the trench and withdraw your sword, that I may drink of the blood and answer your questions truly.

41
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:35,098
So I drew back and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of the blood, he began with his prophecy.

42
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:40,005
You want to know, said he, about your return home, but heaven will make this hard for you.

43
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:46,595
I do not think that you will escape the eye of Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having blinded his son.

44
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:53,625
Still, after much suffering you may get home if you can restrain yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the Thranacian island.

45
00:04:53,605 --> 00:04:58,451
where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything.

46
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:10,685
If you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca, but if you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men.

47
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:16,272
Even though you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing all your men,

48
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:26,808
in another man's ship, and you will find trouble in your house, which will be overrun by high-handed people, who are devouring your substance under the pretext of paying court and making presents to your wife.

49
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:30,072
When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors.

50
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:40,588
And after you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you must take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to a country where the people have never heard of the sea,

51
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:42,770
and do not even mix salt with their food.

52
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:47,395
Nor do they know anything about ships, and oars that are as the wings of a ship.

53
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:51,039
I will give you this certain token which cannot escape your notice.

54
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,524
A wayfarer will meet you and will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your shoulder.

55
00:05:57,045 --> 00:06:01,970
On this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune.

56
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,171
9-0.

57
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:08,196
Then go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven one after the other.

58
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:16,784
As for yourself, death shall come to you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very gently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and your people shall bless you.

59
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:19,547
All that I have said will come true, ninety-one.

60
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:27,574
This, I answered, must be as it may please heaven, but tell me, and tell me, and tell me true, I see my poor mother's ghost close by us.

61
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:33,620
She is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am her own son she does not remember me and speak to me.

62
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,702
Tell me, sir, how I can make her know me.

63
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:38,066
That, said he, I can soon do.

64
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:45,617
Any ghost that you let taste of the blood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not let them have any blood, they will go away again.

65
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:55,852
On this the ghost of Teresias went back to the house of Hades, for his prophesyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until my mother came up and tasted the blood.

66
00:06:56,413 --> 00:07:04,525
Then she knew me at once and spoke fondly to me, saying, My son, how did you come down to this abode of darkness while you were still alive?

67
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:16,219
It is a hard thing for the living to see these places, for between us and them there are great and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no man can cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him.

68
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:24,509
Are you all this time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?"

69
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:29,955
"'Mother,' said I, I was forced to come here to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Tiarius.

70
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:43,815
I have never yet been near the Achaean land nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set out with Agamemnon for Ilias, the land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans.

71
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:47,941
But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?

72
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:53,769
Did you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle, easy passage to eternity?

73
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,715
Tell me also about my father and the son whom I left behind me.

74
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,344
Is my property still in their hands, or has someone else got hold of it who thinks that I shall not return to claim it?

75
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:07,290
Tell me again what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is.

76
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:13,420
Does she live with my son and guard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she could and married again?"

77
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:22,234
My mother answered, "'Your wife still remains in your house, but she is in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night and day.

78
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:27,896
No one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed.

79
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:34,958
He has to entertain largely, as of course he must, considering his position as a magistrate nightoo and how everyone invites him.

80
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:39,015
Your father remains at his old place in the country and never goes near the town.

81
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:41,679
He has no comfortable bed nor bedding.

82
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:54,178
In the winter he sleeps on the floor in front of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground.

83
00:08:54,935 --> 00:09:00,265
He grieves continually about your never having come home, and suffers more and more as he grows older.

84
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:15,475
As for my own end, it was in this wise heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house, nor was I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear people out and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doing in the force of my affection for you.

85
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:17,290
This it was that was the death of me.

86
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,271
93.

87
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:22,157
Then I tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother's ghost.

88
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:35,758
Thrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but each time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and being touched to the quick, I said to her, Mother, why do you not stay still when I would embrace you?

89
00:09:35,738 --> 00:09:41,986
If we could throw our arms around one another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in the house of Hades.

90
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:47,273
Does Proserpine want to lay a still further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?

91
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:55,484
My son, she answered, most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not Proserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when they are dead.

92
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:59,029
The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together.

93
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:05,998
These perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream.

94
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:13,288
Now, however, go back to the light of day as soon as you can and note all these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter."

95
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:20,578
Thus did we converse, and Anon Prosopine sent up the ghosts of the wives and daughters of all the most famous men.

96
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:25,145
They gathered in crowds about the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally.

97
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:32,415
In the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood at once.

98
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:37,443
So they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned her told me her race and lineage.

99
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:39,405
The first I saw was Tyrell.

100
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:44,693
She was daughter of Salmonius and wife of Cretheus, the son of Aeolus.

101
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:49,103
She fell in love with the river Enapeus who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world.

102
00:10:49,765 --> 00:11:01,753
Once when she was taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river and a huge blue wave arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and God,

103
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:05,361
whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.

104
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:12,496
When the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in his own and said, Tyro, rejoice in all good will.

105
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:18,028
The embraces of the gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time, twelve months.

106
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:19,692
Take great care of them.

107
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:24,138
I am Neptune, so now go home, but hold your tongue and do not tell anyone."

108
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:31,429
Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Peleus and Neleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might.

109
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,316
Peleus was a great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in Pylos.

110
00:11:36,837 --> 00:11:43,907
The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely Aeson, Phares, and Amithion, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.

111
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:53,497
Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asipas, who could boast of having slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two sons, Amphion and Zethus.

112
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:58,122
These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and built a wall all round it.

113
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:01,906
For strong though they were, they could not hold Thebes till they had walled it.

114
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:13,759
Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove indomitable Hercules, and Megara, who was daughter to great-king Creon, and married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.

115
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:21,208
I also saw fair Epicast mother of King Oedipides, whose awful lot it was to marry her own son without suspecting it.

116
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,650
He married her after having killed his father.

117
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:31,277
But the gods proclaimed the whole story to the world, whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief for the spite the gods had borne him.

118
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:42,227
But Epicast went to the house of the mighty jailer Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother, to his ruin bitterly thereafter.

119
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:47,252
Then I saw Chloris, whom Nellius married for her beauty, having given priceless presents for her.

120
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:53,838
She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus and was queen in Pylos.

121
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:57,261
She bore Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus.

122
00:12:57,721 --> 00:13:02,606
And she also bore that marvelously lovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country round.

123
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:10,273
But Nellius would only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphicles from the grazing grounds of Phyllis, and this was a hard task.

124
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:20,286
The only man who would undertake to raid them was a certain excellent seer 1095, but the will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison.

125
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:29,417
Nevertheless, when a full year had passed and the same season came round again, Iphicles set him at liberty after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven.

126
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:33,122
Thus then was the will of Jove accomplished.

127
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:40,357
and I saw Leda, the wife of Tindarus, who bore him two famous sons, Casterbreaker of horses, and Pollux, the mighty boxer.

128
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:52,883
Both these heroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for by a special dispensation of Jove, they die and come to life again, each one of them every other day throughout all time, and they have the rank of gods.

129
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:58,266
After her, I saw Aitha Medea, wife of Aloeus, who boasted the embrace of Neptune.

130
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:03,217
She bore two sons, Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short-lived.

131
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,747
They were the finest children that were ever born in this world, and the best-looking.

132
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:12,137
Orion only accepted, for at nine years old they were nine fathoms high,

133
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,220
and measured nine cubits round the chest.

134
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:26,138
They threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried to set Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it too if they had been grown up.

135
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:32,207
But Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or chin.

136
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:41,280
Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the magician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens.

137
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:48,131
But he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so, Diana killed her in the island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.

138
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:54,140
I also saw Mera and Clymene and hateful Eryphile, who sold her own husband for gold.

139
00:14:54,721 --> 00:15:05,197
But it would take me all night if I were to name every single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and it is time for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew or here.

140
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:09,343
As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.

141
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:14,611
Here he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless throughout the covered cloister.

142
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:19,419
Then Arete said to them, What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians?

143
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:22,023
Is he not tall and good-looking, and is he not clever?

144
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:26,370
True, he is my own guest, but all of you share in the distinction.

145
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:35,160
Do not be in a hurry to send him away, nor niggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such great need, for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.

146
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,744
Then spoke the aged hero Achenius, who was one of the oldest men among them.

147
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:50,738
My friends, said he, what our august queen has just said to us is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it, but the decision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with King Alcinius.

148
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:56,942
The thing shall be done, exclaimed Alcinius, as surely as I still live and reign over the Phaeacians.

149
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:59,907
Our guest is indeed very anxious to get home.

150
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:07,140
Still we must persuade him to remain with us until tomorrow, by which time I shall be able to get together the whole sum that I mean to give him.

151
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,667
As regards his escort, it will be a matter for you all, and mine above all others, as the chief person among you."

152
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:34,208
And Ulysses answered, King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to stay here for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded with your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly, and it would redound greatly to my advantage, for I should return fuller-handed to my own people, and should thus be more respected and beloved by all who see me when I get back to Ithaca.

153
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:40,283
"'Ulysses,' replied Alcinous, "'not one of us who sees you has any idea that you are a charlatan or a swindler.'"

154
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:50,759
I know there are many people going about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see through them, but there is a style about your language which assures me of your good disposition.

155
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,828
Moreover, you have told the story of your own misfortunes and those of the Argives as though you were a practice bard.

156
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:05,697
But tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the mighty heroes who went to Troy at the same time with yourself and perished there.

157
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:10,303
The evenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet bedtime.

158
00:17:10,283 --> 00:17:17,492
Go on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay here listening till tomorrow morning, so long as you will continue to tell us of your adventures."

159
00:17:17,512 --> 00:17:23,860
"'Alcinus,' answered Ulysses, "'there is a time for making speeches and a time for going to bed.

160
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:35,734
Nevertheless, since you so desire, I will not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades who did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but perished on their return, through the treachery of a wicked woman.

161
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:46,281
When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, the ghost of Agamemnon's son of Atreus came sadly up to me, surrounded by those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus.

162
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:52,639
As soon as he had tasted the blood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to embrace me.

163
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,287
But he had no strength nor substance any more, and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him.

164
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:00,810
"'How did you come by your death?'

165
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,653
said I, King Agamemnon.

166
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:07,260
"'Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against you when you were at sea?

167
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:16,453
Or did your enemies make an end of you on the main land when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defense of their wives and city?'

168
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:29,987
Ulysses, he answered, noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea in any storm of Neptune's raising, nor did my foes dispatch me upon the mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between them.

169
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:44,634
He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughterhouse, while all around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding breakfast or picnic or gorgeous banquet of some great nobleman.

170
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:50,524
You must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement or in single combat.

171
00:18:50,504 --> 00:19:01,071
But you never saw anything so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood.

172
00:19:01,152 --> 00:19:05,857
I heard Priam's daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me.

173
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:12,245
I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body and raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess.

174
00:19:12,805 --> 00:19:23,137
But she slipped away from me, she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as hers was.

175
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:25,860
Fancy murdering her own husband

176
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:36,353
I thought I was going to be welcomed home by my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace on herself and all women who shall come after, even on the good ones.

177
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:43,021
And I said, in truth, Jove has hated the House of Atreus from first to last in the matter of their women's counsels.

178
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:50,751
See how many of us fell for Helen's sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief against you too during your absence.

179
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:55,677
Be sure, therefore," continued Agamemnon, and not be too friendly even with your own wife.

180
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:58,941
Do not tell her all that you know perfectly well yourself.

181
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:02,545
Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about the rest.

182
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:09,814
Not that your wife Ulysses is likely to murder you, for Penelope is a very admirable woman and has an excellent nature.

183
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:14,680
We left her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for Troy.

184
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:24,332
This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man's estate, 96, and he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one another as it is right they should do.

185
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:30,505
whereas my wicked wife did not even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I could do so.

186
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:40,419
Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, do not tell people when you are bringing your ship to Ithaca, but steal a march upon them, for after all this there is no trusting women.

187
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:45,305
But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news of my son Orestes?

188
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:50,632
Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with Menelaus?

189
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:53,256
For I presume that he is still living.

190
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:56,046
And I said, Agamemnon, why do you ask me?

191
00:20:56,608 --> 00:21:02,048
I do not know whether your son is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does not know.

192
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:14,726
As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another, the ghost of Achilles came up to us with Patrotlus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and goodliest man of all the Daenons after the son of Peleus.

193
00:21:15,247 --> 00:21:30,482
The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me, and spoke piteously, saying, Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring will you want to take next, that you venture down to the house of Hades among us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labor no more?

194
00:21:30,462 --> 00:21:47,053
And I said, Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, I came to consult Tereus, and see if he could advise me about my return home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to get near the Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have been in trouble all the time.

195
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:59,648
As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are here, you are a great prince among the dead.

196
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,252
Do not, therefore, take it so much to heart even if you are dead."

197
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:05,294
Say not a word," he answered.

198
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:12,062
In death's favor, I would rather be a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of kings among the dead.

199
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:14,019
But give me news about my son.

200
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,967
Is he gone to the wars, and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so?

201
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:21,975
Tell me also if you have heard anything about my father Peleus.

202
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:30,473
Does he still rule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout Hellas and Phaethia, now that he is old and his limbs fail him?

203
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:37,723
Could I but stand by his side in the light of day with the same strength that I had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy.

204
00:22:37,763 --> 00:22:46,676
Could I but be as I then was and go even for a short time to my father's house, anyone who tried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.

205
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:56,410
I have heard nothing, I answered, of Peleus, but I can tell you all about your son the Optolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Syros with the Achaeans.

206
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:02,759
In our councils of war before Troy, he was always first to speak, and his judgment was unerring.

207
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:15,195
Nestor and I were the only two who could surpass him, and when it came to fighting on the plain of Troy he would never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valor.

208
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:17,959
Many a man did he kill in battle,

209
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:30,505
I cannot name every single one of those whom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how he killed that valiant hero Eurybilus, son of Telephus, who was the handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon.

210
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:35,695
Many others also of the Cetaeans fell around him by reason of a woman's bribes.

211
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:51,507
Moreover, when all the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeius had made, and it was left to me to settle when we should either open the door of our ambuscade or close it, though all the other leaders and chief men among the Danians were drying their eyes and quaking in every limb,

212
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:55,113
I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek.

213
00:23:55,454 --> 00:24:03,127
He was all the time urging me to break out from the horse, grasping the handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury against the foe.

214
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:08,837
Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam, he got his handsome share of the prize money and went on board.

215
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:17,390
Such is the fortune of war without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.

216
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:26,323
When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the prowess of his son.

217
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:34,875
The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own melancholy tale, but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof.

218
00:24:35,176 --> 00:24:39,340
still angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armor of Achilles.

219
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:44,765
Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges.

220
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:54,815
Would that I had never gained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who was foremost of all the Daenons after the son of Peleus, alike in stature and prowess.

221
00:24:55,515 --> 00:25:04,744
When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, Ajax, will you not forget and forgive even in death, but must the judgment about that hateful armor still rankle with you?

222
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:09,522
It cost us Argives dear enough to lose such a tower of strength as you were to us.

223
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:13,431
We mourned you as much as we mourned Achilles, son of Peleus himself.

224
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:21,248
Nor can the blame be laid on anything but on the spite which Jove bore against the Danians, for it was this that made him counsel your destruction.

225
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:26,135
Come hither therefore, bring your proud spirit into subjection, and hear what I can tell you."

226
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:30,381
He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other ghosts.

227
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:40,256
Nevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his being so angry, or I should have gone on talking to him, ninety-seven only, that there were still others among the dead whom I desired to see.

228
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:46,425
Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden scepter in his hand sitting in judgment on the dead.

229
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:53,016
and the ghosts were gathered sitting and standing round him in the spacious house of Hades to learn his sentences upon them.

230
00:25:53,737 --> 00:26:05,697
After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the ghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and he had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.

231
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:10,927
And I saw Titya son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering some nine acres of ground.

232
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:24,428
Two vultures on either side of him were digging their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat them off with his hands, but could not, for he had violated Jove's mistress Leto as she was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.

233
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:28,875
I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake that reached his chin.

234
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:40,352
He was dying to quench his thirst, but could never reach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped to drink, it dried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dry ground parched by the spite of heaven.

235
00:26:40,873 --> 00:26:52,170
There were tall trees, moreover, that shed their fruit over his head—pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet figs, and juicy olives—but whenever the poor creature stretched out his hand to take some,

236
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,834
The wind tossed the branches back again to the clouds.

237
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:59,960
And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone with both his hands.

238
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:03,525
With hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the top of the hill.

239
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:13,058
But always, just before he could roll it over onto the other side, its weight would be too much for him, and the pitiless stone 9a8 would come thundering down again onto the plain.

240
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:19,727
Then he would begin trying to push it uphill again, and the sweat ran off him and the steam rose after him.

241
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:29,939
After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he is feasting ever with the immortal gods and has lovely Hebe to wife, who is daughter of Jove and Juno.

242
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,004
The ghosts were screaming round him like scared birds flying all withers.

243
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:42,154
He looked black as night with his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string, glaring around as though ever on the point of taking aim.

244
00:27:42,134 --> 00:27:51,648
About his breast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellous fashion, with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes.

245
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:54,612
There was also war, battle, and death.

246
00:27:55,573 --> 00:28:00,300
The man who made that belt, do what he might, would never be able to make another like it.

247
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:05,087
Hercules knew me at once when he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying,

248
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:11,665
My poor Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are you too leading the same sorry kind of life that I did when I was above ground?

249
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:21,591
I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of suffering, for I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me, a low fellow who set me all manner of labours.

250
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:26,710
He once sent me here to fetch the hell hound, for he did not think he could find anything harder for me than this.

251
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:31,477
But I got the hound out of Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped me.

252
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:38,708
On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I stayed where I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me.

253
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:44,136
And I should have seen still other of them that are gone before, whom I would fain have seen.
