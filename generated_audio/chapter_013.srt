00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:12,672
CHAPTER XIII WHEELBARROW Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill, using, however, my comrade's money.

2
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:26,494
The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg, especially as Peter Coffin's cock-and-bull stories about him

3
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:32,967
had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now accompanied with.

4
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:40,182
We borrowed a wheelbarrow in embarking our things, including my own poor carpet-bag and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock.

5
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:42,787
Away we went down to the moss.

6
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:46,575
The little Nantucket packet-schooner moored at the wharf.

7
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:48,613
"'Yes,' he asked.

8
00:00:48,934 --> 00:01:01,829
As we were going along, the people stared not at Queequeg so much, for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets, but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.

9
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:12,681
But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrel by turns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs.

10
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:20,871
I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling-ships did not find their own harpoons.

11
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:36,171
To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat,

12
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,794
and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.

13
00:01:39,054 --> 00:01:57,636
In short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmer's meadows armed with their own scythes though in no wise obliged to furnish them even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon, shifting the barrel from my hand to his,

14
00:01:57,616 --> 00:02:01,843
He told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.

15
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,107
It was in Sague Harbor.

16
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:11,500
The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding-house.

17
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:20,856
Not to seem ignorant about the thing, though, in truth, he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow Queequeg.

18
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:27,811
puts his chest upon it, lashes it fast, and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf.

19
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:33,523
"'Why,' said I, "'queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would think.

20
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:35,166
Didn't the people laugh?'

21
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,715
Upon this he told me another story.

22
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:50,276
The people of his island of Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts, express the fragrant water of young coconuts into a large stained calabash like a punch-bowl.

23
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:57,610
And this punch-bowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held.

24
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:17,387
Now a certain grand merchant-ship once touched at Rocovoco, and its commander from all accounts—a very stately, punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea-captain this commander was invited to the wedding-feast of Cui-cui's sister, a pretty young princess, just turned of ten.

25
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:33,840
Well, when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage, this captain marches in, and, being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over against the punch-bowl, and, between the High Priest and His Majesty the King,

26
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,022
Queequeg's father.

27
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:52,926
Grace being said, for those people have their grace as well as we, though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great giver of all feast-grace, I say, being said,

28
00:03:52,906 --> 00:04:04,602
The High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the Island Pichtat, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.

29
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:22,626
Seeing himself placed next to the priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking himself being captain of a ship as having plain precedence over a mere island king, especially in the king's own house the captain poorly proceeds to wash his hands in the punch-bowl,

30
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:26,596
Taking it, I suppose, for a huge finger-glass.

31
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:30,245
Now, said Queequeg, what you think now?

32
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,089
Didn't our people laugh?

33
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:37,763
At last passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.

34
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:41,049
Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet River.

35
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:49,185
On one side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear cold air.

36
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:59,464
Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her walves, and side by side the world-wandering whale-ships lay silent and safely moored at last.

37
00:04:59,444 --> 00:05:08,821
All from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start.

38
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:19,039
But pear to ath one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second, and the second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye.

39
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:24,215
Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.

40
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:34,918
Dating the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh, the little moss tossed the quick foam from her boughs as a young colt his snortings.

41
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,836
how I snuffed that tartar air, how I spurned that turnpike earth.

42
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:51,355
That common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs, and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.

43
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:55,701
At the same foam fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink in reel with me.

44
00:05:56,162 --> 00:06:00,428
His dusky nostrils swelled apart, he showed his filed and pointed teeth.

45
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,595
On, on we flew, and our offing gained.

46
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:10,443
The moss did homage to the blast, ducked and dived her boughs as a slave before the Sultan.

47
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:20,498
Sideways leaning, we sideways darted every rope-yarn tingling like a wire, the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes and land tornadoes.

48
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:36,529
So full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marveled that two fellow-beings should be so

49
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:42,859
As though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.

50
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:52,334
But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and center of all verger.

51
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:58,483
Kwekwe caught one of these young saplings, mimicking him behind his back.

52
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:01,306
I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come.

53
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:12,099
Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air.

54
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:28,318
Then, slightly tapping his stern in mid-summerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.

55
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:31,220
yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer.

56
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,281
"'Captain!

57
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:33,121
Captain!

58
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:34,303
Here's the devil!'

59
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:40,749
"'Hello, you sir,' cried the captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to Queequeg.

60
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:43,451
"'What in thunder do you mean by that?

61
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:46,074
Don't you know you might have killed that chap?'

62
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:46,975
"'What him say?'

63
00:07:47,295 --> 00:07:49,457
said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.

64
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:57,985
"'He say,' said I, "'that you came near Killy that man there,' pointing to the still-shivering greenhorn.

65
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:58,786
"'Kill ye!"

66
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:03,872
cried Kweekeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain.

67
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:06,875
"'Ah, him bevy smally fish, eh!

68
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:08,978
Kweekeg no kill ye!

69
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:12,962
So smally fish, eh, Kweekeg, kill ye big whale!'

70
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:19,069
"'Look, you,' rod the captain, "'I'll kill ye you, you cannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here.

71
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:26,638
So mind your eye—' But it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye.

72
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:39,592
The prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after-part of the deck.

73
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:50,085
The poor fellow, whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard, all hands were in a panic, and, to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness.

74
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:56,473
It flew from right to left and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch.

75
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:01,060
and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.

76
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:13,839
Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck, rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale.

77
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:21,330
In the midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of the boom,

78
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:37,564
whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then, flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and, at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe.

79
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:50,263
The schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Kwekweg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.

80
00:09:50,283 --> 00:10:02,742
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long arm straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.

81
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:07,552
I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.

82
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,636
The greenhorn had gone down.

83
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:21,760
Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg now took an instant's glance around him, and, seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.

84
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:28,678
A few minutes more and he rose again, one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form.

85
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:31,185
The boat soon picked them up.

86
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,930
The poor bumpkin was restored.

87
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,880
All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump.

88
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,744
The captain begged his pardon.

89
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:46,620
From that hour I cloved to Queequeg like a barnacle, yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.

90
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:49,406
Was there ever such unconsciousness?

91
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:55,999
He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies

92
00:10:55,979 --> 00:11:01,187
He only asked for water, fresh water, something, to wipe the brine off that done.

93
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:15,428
He put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to himself, It's a mutual joint-stock world in all meridians.

94
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,493
We cannibals must help these Christians.
