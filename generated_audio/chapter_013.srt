CHAPTER XIII - Wheelbarrow

3
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:12,832
Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill, using, however, my comrade's money.

4
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:21,246
The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg.

5
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:29,099
especially as Peter Coffin's cock-and-bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now accompanied with.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:42,340
We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor carpet bag and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to the moss the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:52,135
As we were going along the people stared, not at Queequeg so much, for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets, but had seen him and me upon such confidential terms.

8
00:00:52,736 --> 00:01:01,510
But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs.

9
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:08,413
I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons.

10
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:23,977
To this, in substance he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.

11
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,683
In short, like many inland reapers and mowers,

12
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:33,334
who go into the farmer's meadows armed with their own scythes, though in no wise obliged to furnish them.

13
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:39,146
Even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.

14
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:46,180
Shifting the barrel from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,945
It was in Sag Harbor.

16
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:54,695
The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house.

17
00:01:55,336 --> 00:02:02,525
Not to seem ignorant about the thing, though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow.

18
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:08,993
Queequeg puts his chest upon it, lashes it fast, and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf.

19
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:09,667
Why?"

20
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:13,431
said I. Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would think.

21
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:14,833
Didn't the people laugh?

22
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:17,577
Upon this he told me another story.

23
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:33,377
The people of his island of Rocavoco, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young coconuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl, and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held.

24
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:44,953
Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rocovoco, and its commander, from all accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain.

25
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:52,309
This commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten.

26
00:02:52,369 --> 00:03:07,403
Well, when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage, this captain marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the king, Queequeg's father.

27
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:12,308
Grace being said, for those people have their grace as well as we.

28
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:23,260
Though Queequeg told me that, unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts.

29
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:30,972
Grace, I say, being said, the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island.

30
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:49,399
that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates, seeing himself placed next the priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking himself, being captain of a ship, as having plain precedence over a mere island king, especially in the king's own house.

31
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:55,531
The captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl, taking it, I suppose, for a huge fingerglass.

32
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:58,695
Now, said Queequeg, what you tink now?

33
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,457
Didn't our people laugh?

34
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:05,644
At last, passage paid and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.

35
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:09,649
Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet River.

36
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:16,584
On one side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear, cold air.

37
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:27,807
Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale-ships lay silent and safely moored at last.

38
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:47,539
while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start, that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second, and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever, and for aye.

39
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,389
Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.

40
00:04:53,369 --> 00:05:01,834
Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh, the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings.

41
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,221
How I snuffed that tartar air!

42
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:07,210
How I spurned that turnpike earth!

43
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:16,444
That common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs, and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.

44
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:20,791
At the same foam fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.

45
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:25,538
His dusky nostrils swelled apart, he showed his filed and pointed teeth.

46
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:35,273
On, on we flew, and our offing gained, the moss did homage to the blast, ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan.

47
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:44,514
Sideways leaning, we sideways darted, every rope yarn tingling like a wire, the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.

48
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:50,528
So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit,

49
00:05:50,508 --> 00:06:05,648
that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marveled that two fellow-beings should be so companionable, as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.

50
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:13,699
But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and center of all verdure.

51
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,127
Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back.

52
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:21,713
I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come.

53
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:31,664
Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms and, by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air.

54
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:44,017
Then, slightly tapping his stern in mid-summerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.

55
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:45,158
Captain!

56
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:46,019
Captain!

57
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,762
yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer.

58
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:49,583
Captain!

59
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:50,284
Captain!

60
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:51,565
Here's the devil!

61
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:56,389
"'Hello, you, sir,' cried the captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to Queequeg.

62
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,112
"'What in thunder do you mean by that?

63
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:00,595
"'Don't you know you might have killed that chap?'

64
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:04,562
"'What him say,' said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.

65
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:11,292
"'He say,' said I, "'that you came near Killee, that man there,' pointing to the still-shivering greenhorn.

66
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:16,079
Killy, cried Kwekwek, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain.

67
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,750
Ah, him bevy smally fishy, Kwekwek no killy so smally fishy, Kwekwek killy big whale.

68
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:26,855
Look you, roared the captain, I'll killy.

69
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:32,303
You, you, you cannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here, so mind your eye.

70
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:37,971
But it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye.

71
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:49,058
The prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted the weather sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.

72
00:07:49,983 --> 00:08:00,058
The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard, all hands were in a panic, and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness.

73
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:09,172
It flew from right to left and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.

74
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:13,999
Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done.

75
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:20,590
Those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale.

76
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:40,003
In the midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and, crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then, flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped and all was safe.

77
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:49,556
The schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.

78
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:59,590
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.

79
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:04,236
I looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved.

80
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,863
The greenhorn had gone down.

81
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:16,081
Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.

82
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:23,895
A few minutes more and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form.

83
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,218
The boat soon picked them up.

84
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,584
The poor bumpkin was restored.

85
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:29,950
All hands voted Queequeg.

86
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:33,279
A noble trump, the captain begged his pardon.

87
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:40,838
From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle, yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.

88
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:42,662
Was there ever such unconsciousness?

89
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:48,717
He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies.

90
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,990
He only asked for water, fresh water, something to wipe the brine off.

91
00:09:54,311 --> 00:10:06,480
That done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to himself, it's a mutual joint-stock world in all meridians.

92
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:09,407
We cannibals must help these Christians.
