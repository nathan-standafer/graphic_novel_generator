00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,139
Chapter 125 - The Log and Line.

2
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:09,967
While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log and line had but very seldom been in use.

3
00:00:10,688 --> 00:00:32,957
Owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessel's place, some merchantmen, and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log, though at the same time, and frequently more for form's sake than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour.

4
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,885
It had been thus with the Pequod.

5
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:41,780
The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks.

6
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:50,760
Rains and spray had damped it, sun and wind had warped it, all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly.

7
00:00:50,740 --> 00:01:04,395
but heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab as he happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line.

8
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:09,240
The ship was sailing plungingly, astern, the billows rolled in riots.

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,621
Forward there!

10
00:01:10,982 --> 00:01:11,782
Heave the log!

11
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:17,068
Two seamen came, the golden-hued Tahitian and the grisly Manxman,

12
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:18,973
Take the reel, one of ye, I'll heave."

13
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:30,501
They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship's lee side, where the deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into the creamy, sidelong, rushing sea.

14
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:44,291
The manksman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting handle ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.

15
00:01:44,952 --> 00:01:58,311
Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary hand coil to toss overboard, when the old manksman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to speak.

16
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,833
Sir, I mistrust it.

17
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:01,656
This line looks far gone.

18
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:03,740
Long heat and wet have spoiled it.

19
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,623
Twill hold, old gentleman.

20
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,047
Long heat and wet have they spoiled thee.

21
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:09,469
Thou seems to hold.

22
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,095
Or, truer, perhaps, life holds thee, not thou it.

23
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:15,038
I hold the spool, sir.

24
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:24,012
But just as my captain says, With these grey hairs of mine tis not worth while disputing, Specially with a superior, who'll ne'er confess.

25
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:24,752
What's that?

26
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:31,001
There now's a patched professor in Queen Nature's granite-founded college, but methinks he's too subservient.

27
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:32,483
Where wert thou born?

28
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:34,967
In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.

29
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:36,148
Excellent!

30
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:37,651
Thou'st hit the world by that.

31
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,894
I know not, sir, but I was born there.

32
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,636
In the Isle of Man, hey?

33
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,499
Well, the other way.

34
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:44,180
It's good.

35
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:51,771
Here's a man from man, a man born in once independent man, and now unmanned of man, which is sucked in.

36
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:52,252
By what?

37
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:53,433
Up with the reel!

38
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:57,038
The dead, blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last.

39
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:58,059
Up with it!

40
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,020
Sew!

41
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:00,943
The log was heaved.

42
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:08,432
The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long, dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl.

43
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:17,003
In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.

44
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:18,746
Hold hard!

45
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:19,767
Snap!

46
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:23,721
The overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon.

47
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:25,585
The tugging log was gone.

48
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:32,440
I crushed the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea parts the log line.

49
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:34,094
But Ahab can mend all.

50
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,076
Haul in here, Tahitian!

51
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:37,317
Reel up, Manxman!

52
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:43,063
And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, And mend thou the line, see to it.

53
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:44,944
There he goes now.

54
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:51,210
To him nothing's happened, but to me The skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world.

55
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,833
Haul in, haul in, Tahitian!

56
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:59,558
These lines run whole and whirling out, Come in broken and dragging slow.

57
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:00,386
Ha, Pip.

58
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,910
Come to help, eh, Pip?

59
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:03,033
Pip?

60
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:04,617
Whom call ye Pip?

61
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:06,782
Pip jumped from the whale boat.

62
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:08,466
Pip's missing.

63
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,874
Let's see now if ye haven't fished him up here, fisherman.

64
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:13,418
It drags hard.

65
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:14,982
I guess he's holding on.

66
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:16,529
Jerk him, Tahiti!

67
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,591
Jerk him off!

68
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,133
We haul in no cowards here!

69
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:20,194
Ho!

70
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:22,277
There's his arm just breaking water!

71
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:23,378
A hatchet!

72
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:24,219
A hatchet!

73
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,321
Cut it off!

74
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,043
We haul in no cowards here!

75
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:28,745
Captain Ahab!

76
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:29,486
Sir!

77
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:29,926
Sir!

78
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,670
Here's Pip, trying to get on board again!

79
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,893
Peace, thou crazy loon!

80
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:37,296
cried the manksman, seizing him by the arm.

81
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,078
Away from the quarterdeck!

82
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,942
The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser!

83
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:43,804
muttered Ahab, advancing.

84
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,626
Hands off from that holiness.

85
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:47,889
Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?

86
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:50,292
A stern there, sir, a stern.

87
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:51,573
Low, low.

88
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:53,215
And who art thou, boy?

89
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:57,160
I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes.

90
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:01,846
O God, that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through.

91
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,127
Who art thou, boy?

92
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:04,148
Bell boy.

93
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:06,571
Bell boy, sir, ship's crier.

94
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:09,775
Ding, dong, ding, ding, pip, pip.

95
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:13,480
One hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip, five feet high.

96
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:15,984
Looks cowardly, quickest known by that.

97
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:16,845
Ding!

98
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:17,366
Dong!

99
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:17,847
Ding!

100
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:19,730
Who's seen Pip the coward?

101
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:22,514
There can be no hearts above the snow line.

102
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:25,879
Oh, ye frozen heavens, look down here.

103
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:31,527
Ye did beget this luckless child and have abandoned him, ye creative libertines.

104
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:36,481
Here, boy, Ahab's cabin shall be Pip's home henceforth while Ahab lives.

105
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:43,040
Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy, thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings.

106
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,347
Come, let's down.

107
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:46,789
What's this?

108
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,916
Here's velvet sharkskin, intently gazing at Ahab's hand and feeling it.

109
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:58,726
Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this, perhaps he had ne'er been lost.

110
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:04,413
This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope, something that weak souls may hold by.

111
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:12,685
Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together, the black one with the white, for I will not let this go.

112
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:17,752
O boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here.

113
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:19,715
Come then to my cabin.

114
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:25,202
Lo, ye believers in God's all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you!

115
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:35,336
See the omniscient God's oblivious of suffering man, and man, though idiotic, and knowing not what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude.

116
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,698
Come!

117
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:41,173
I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand than though I grasped an emperor's.

118
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:48,346
There go two daft ones now, muttered the old manksman, one daft with strength, the other daft with weakness.

119
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:52,534
But here's the end of the rotten lime, all dripping too.

120
00:06:53,315 --> 00:06:54,036
Mend it, eh?

121
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:56,982
I think we had best have a new line altogether.

122
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,226
I'll see Mr. Stubb about it.
