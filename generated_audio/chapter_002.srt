Chapter 2 - The Carpet Bag 

2
00:00:03,884 --> 00:00:13,130
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn in the Pacific.  Quitting the good city of Old Manhattan, I duly arrived in New Bedford.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,072
It was a Saturday night in December.

4
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:23,845
Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following Monday.

5
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:35,224
As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.

6
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:46,423
For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me.

7
00:00:46,403 --> 00:01:01,843
Besides, though, New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original, the Tyre of this Carthage, the place where the first dead American whale was stranded.

8
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:09,272
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Redmen, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan?

9
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:16,946
And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones?

10
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:25,101
So goes the story, to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit.

11
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:36,233
Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.

12
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:42,923
It was a very dubious looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.

13
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,626
I knew no one in the place.

14
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:50,194
With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver.

15
00:01:51,203 --> 00:02:01,199
So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south.

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:08,672
Wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price and don't be too particular.

17
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:17,346
With halting steps I paced the streets and passed the sign of the crossed harpoons, but it looked too expensive and jolly there.

18
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:40,465
Further on, from the bright red windows of the Swordfish Inn, there came such fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement, rather weary for me when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight.

19
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:48,717
Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.

20
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:51,601
But go on, Ishmael, said I at last.

21
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:52,442
Don't you hear?

22
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,084
Get away from before the door.

23
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:56,047
Your patched boots are stopping the way.

24
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:57,429
So on I went.

25
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:05,440
I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest, inns.

26
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,904
Such dreary streets.

27
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:14,144
Blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb.

28
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:20,762
At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted.

29
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:27,271
But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open.

30
00:03:27,952 --> 00:03:36,810
It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public, so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch.

31
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,594
Ha, thought I. Ha, as the flying particles almost choked me.

32
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,457
Are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gamora?

33
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:46,361
But the crossed harpoons and the swordfish.

34
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:49,745
This then must needs be the sign of the trap.

35
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:56,973
However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second interior door.

36
00:03:57,553 --> 00:04:00,857
It seemed the great black parliament sitting in Tophet.

37
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:08,068
A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer, and beyond, a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit.

38
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:15,919
It was a negro church, and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth gnashing there.

39
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,968
Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, wretched entertainment at the sign of, the trap!

40
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:38,387
Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air, and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneath.

41
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:40,250
The Spouter Inn, Peter Coffin.

42
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,131
Coffin?

43
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:42,072
Spouter?

44
00:04:42,914 --> 00:05:03,463
Rather ominous in that particular connection, thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there, as the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district.

45
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:11,980
And as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee.

46
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:20,237
It was a queer sort of place, a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it were and leaning over sadly.

47
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:28,257
It stood on a sharp, bleak corner where that tempestuous wind Eurocliden kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft.

48
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:36,657
Eurocliden, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to anyone indoors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.

49
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:58,881
In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclidon, says an old writer, of whose works I possess the only copy extant, it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the white death is the only glazier.

50
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:02,248
True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind.

51
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:05,194
Old black letter, thou reasonest well.

52
00:06:06,196 --> 00:06:09,743
Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house.

53
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:15,655
What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks in the crannies, though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.

54
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:17,818
But it's too late to make any improvements now.

55
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:23,826
The universe is finished, the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.

56
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:31,236
Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings.

57
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:35,382
He might plug up both ears with rags and put a corncob into his mouth.

58
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,467
And yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclidon.

59
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:42,232
Euroclidon, says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper.

60
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,855
He had a redder one afterwards.

61
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:44,335
Hoo!

62
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:44,876
Poo!

63
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,579
What a fine frosty night!

64
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:47,800
How Orion glitters!

65
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:48,982
What northern lights!

66
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,729
Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories.

67
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,416
Give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.

68
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:00,199
But what thinks Lazarus?

69
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:04,912
Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights?

70
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:08,441
Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here?

71
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:13,755
Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator?

72
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:20,291
Go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost.

73
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:26,045
Now that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the kerbstone before the door of dives.

74
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:30,495
This is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas.

75
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:41,115
Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Tsar in an ice palace made of frozen size, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.

76
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:43,560
But no more of this blubbering now.

77
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:47,687
We are going awailing, and there is plenty of that yet to come.

78
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,378
Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort of a place this spouter may be.
