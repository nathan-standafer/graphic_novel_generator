00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:09,820
CHAPTER II THE CARPET-BAG I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,884
Quitting the good city of old Manhattan, I duly arrived in New Bedford.

3
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:17,387
It was a Saturday night in December.

4
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:30,038
Much as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at the same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for

5
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:46,069
had no idea of so doing, for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.

6
00:00:46,049 --> 00:01:06,394
Besides, though, New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original attire of this Carthage, the place where the first dead American whale was stranded.

7
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:15,465
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Redmen, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan?

8
00:01:15,682 --> 00:01:22,636
And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth?

9
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:34,078
Partly laden with imported cobblestones, so, goes the story to throw at the whales, in order to discover, when they were nigh enough, to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit.

10
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:47,240
Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep.

11
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:55,273
Meanwhile it was a very dubious looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.

12
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:56,916
I knew no one in the place.

13
00:01:57,056 --> 00:02:03,246
With anxious gratinals I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver.

14
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:20,434
So, wherever you go, Ishmael," said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street, shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south, wherever, in your wisdom, you may conclude to lodge for the night,

15
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:26,148
My dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don't be too particular."

16
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:32,905
With halting steps I paced the streets and passed a sign ofâ€”The Crossed Harpoons.

17
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:35,941
but it looked too expensive and jolly there.

18
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:53,391
Further on, from the bright red windows of the Swordfish Inn, there came such fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement.

19
00:02:53,371 --> 00:03:05,405
Rather weary for me when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight.

20
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:16,037
Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.

21
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:19,908
But go on, Ishmael," said I at last.

22
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:21,231
Don't you hear?

23
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:23,135
Get away from before the door.

24
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:25,420
Your patched boots are stopping the way.

25
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:26,443
So on I went.

26
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:35,764
I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest, inns.

27
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:45,559
Such dreary streets, blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb.

28
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:57,617
At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted, but presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building

29
00:03:57,597 --> 00:03:59,719
the door of which stood invitingly open.

30
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:04,545
It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public.

31
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:10,532
So, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch.

32
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,194
Ha!

33
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:13,395
thought I, ha!

34
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:16,178
as the flying particles almost choked me.

35
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,862
Are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gamora?

36
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:23,126
But the crossed harpoons and the sword-fish?

37
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:27,351
This, then, must needs be the sign of the trap.

38
00:04:27,331 --> 00:04:35,602
However, I picked myself up and, hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second interior door.

39
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,946
It seemed the great black Parliament sitting in Tophet.

40
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:42,651
All hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer in beyond.

41
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:46,376
A black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit.

42
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:56,730
It was a negro church, and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth gnashing there.

43
00:04:57,082 --> 00:05:03,132
Hush, male," muttered I, backing out, wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap.

44
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:12,728
Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air, and looking up

45
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:25,211
saw a swinging sign over the door, with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath, the spouter in Peter Coffin.

46
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:25,712
Coffin?

47
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:26,714
Spouter?

48
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:30,801
Rather ominous in that particular connection, thought I.

49
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:52,097
But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there, as the light looked so dim, and the place for the time looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district.

50
00:05:52,077 --> 00:06:02,621
and, as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea-coffee.

51
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:11,200
It was a queer sort of place, a gable-ended old house, one side posited, as it were, and leaning over sadly.

52
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:21,356
It stood on a sharp, bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind, Eurycleidon, kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft.

53
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:30,150
Eurycleidon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to anyone indoors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.

54
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:58,433
In judging of that tempestuous wind called Uroclodon," says an old writer of, whose works I possess the only copy extented, maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out it from a glass window, where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the white death is the only glazier.

55
00:06:58,413 --> 00:07:03,581
True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind, old black letter.

56
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,672
Thou reasonest well.

57
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:11,152
Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house.

58
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:18,399
What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies, though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.

59
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,961
But it's too late to make any improvements now.

60
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:28,588
The universe is finished, the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago."

61
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:36,655
Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the kerbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings.

62
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:46,965
he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corncob into his mouth, and yet that would not heap out the tempestuous Eurocleidon.

63
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:50,963
You're a climb, says old Dives in his red silken wrapper.

64
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,786
He had a redder one afterwards.

65
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,391
Pooh, pooh, what a fine frosty night!

66
00:07:57,252 --> 00:07:59,495
How Orient glitters, what northern lights!

67
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:04,562
Let them talk of their Oriental summer climbs Of everlasting conservatories.

68
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:09,529
Give me the privilege Of making my own summer with my own coals.

69
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,733
But what thinks Lazarus?

70
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:17,020
Can he warm his blue hands By holding them up to the grand northern lights?

71
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,744
Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here?

72
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:24,831
Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator?

73
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:26,813
Yah, yah, gods!

74
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:31,680
Go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost.

75
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:44,037
Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the kerbstone, before the door of dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas.

76
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:56,481
Yet dives himself, he too lives like a czar In an ice palace made of frozen size, And, being a president of a temperate society, He only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.

77
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:03,535
But no more of this blubbering now, We are going a-whaling, And there is plenty of that yet to come.

78
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:10,328
Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, And see what sort of a place this spouter may be.
