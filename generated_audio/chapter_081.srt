00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,952
Chapter 81 - The Pequod Meets the Virgin

2
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:11,503
Chapter 81 - The Pequod Meets the Virgin. The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship, Jungfrau, Derek de Deer, Master of Bremen.

3
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:25,397
At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and Germans are now among the least, but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific.

4
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:29,072
For some reason, the Zhongfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.

5
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:40,062
While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern.

6
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:42,066
What has he in his hand there?"

7
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:45,991
cried Starbuck, pointing to something wavingly held by the German.

8
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:47,493
Impossible!

9
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:48,574
A lamp-feeder!

10
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:50,637
Not that, said Stubb.

11
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:53,441
No, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck.

12
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:56,465
He's coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman.

13
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:59,629
Don't you see that big tin can there alongside of him?

14
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,051
That's his boiling water.

15
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:04,075
Oh, he's all right, is the Yarman.

16
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:05,898
"'Go along with you,' cried Flask.

17
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:07,941
"'It's a lamp-feeder and an oil can.

18
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,164
"'He's out of oil and has come a-begging.'"

19
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:23,922
However curious it may seem for an oil ship to be borrowing oil on the whale ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing really happens.

20
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:31,092
And in the present case, Captain Derek DeDeer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder, as Flask did declare.

21
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:36,584
As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding what he had in his hand.

22
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:50,515
But in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale, immediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching as having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness.

23
00:01:50,984 --> 00:02:07,930
his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying fish yet captured to supply the deficiency, concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically called a clean one, that is, an empty one, well deserving the name of Jumfrau or the Virgin.

24
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:26,935
His necessities supplied, Derek departed, but he had not gained his ship's side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels, and so eager for the chase was Derek, that without pausing to put his oil can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.

25
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:36,027
Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod's keels.

26
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:38,796
There were eight whales, an average pod.

27
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:49,037
Aware of their danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness.

28
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:55,138
they left a great wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.

29
00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:11,937
Full in this rabid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity.

30
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:20,273
Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable, for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.

31
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:33,418
Nevertheless he stuck to their wake, though indeed their backwater must have retarded him, because the white bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet.

32
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:49,483
His spout was short, slow and laborious, coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the waters behind him to up-bubble.

33
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:51,859
Who's got some paragoric?"

34
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,500
said Stubb.

35
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:54,384
He has the stomachache, I'm afraid.

36
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:57,631
Lord, think of having half an acre of stomachache.

37
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:00,638
Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys.

38
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,025
It's the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from a stern.

39
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,791
But look, did ever wail yaw so before?

40
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,497
It must be he's lost his tiller.

41
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:31,688
As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deckload of frightened horses, careens, berries, rolls, and wallows on her way, so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then, partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin.

42
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:36,219
Whether he had lost that fin in battle or had been born without it, it were hard to say.

43
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:43,797
Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll give you a sling for that wounded arm, cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.

44
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,165
Mind he don't sling thee with it, cried Starbuck.

45
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:49,390
Give way, or the German will have him.

46
00:04:49,370 --> 00:05:06,332
With one intent, all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish, because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time.

47
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:19,849
At this juncture, the Pequod's keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered, but from the great start he had had, Derek's boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his foreign rivals.

48
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:28,725
The only thing they feared was that from being already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him.

49
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:37,134
As for Derek, he seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp feeder at the other boats.

50
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:41,078
The ungracious and ungrateful dog, cried Starbuck.

51
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:46,444
He mocks and dares me with the very poor box I filled for him not five minutes ago.

52
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:49,979
Then in his old intense whisper, Give way, greyhounds!

53
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,161
Dog to it!

54
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:54,687
I tell you what it is, men, cried Stubb to his crew.

55
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:59,435
It's against my religion to get mad, But I'd like to eat that villainous Yarman.

56
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,657
Pull, won't ye?

57
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:02,680
Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye?

58
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,162
Do ye love brandy?

59
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:07,167
A hog's head of brandy, then, to the best man.

60
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:09,747
Come, why don't some of ye burst a blood vessel?

61
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,132
Who's that been dropping an anchor overboard?

62
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:14,377
We don't budge an inch, we're becalmed.

63
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:21,493
Halloo, here's grass growing in the boat's bottom, And by the Lord, the mast there's budding.

64
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:22,645
This won't do, boys.

65
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:24,147
Look at that yarman.

66
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:26,450
The short and long of it is, men.

67
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,432
Will ye spit fire or not?

68
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:33,419
Oh, see the suds he makes," cried Flask, dancing up and down.

69
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,620
What a hump!

70
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,864
Oh, Dio, pile on the beef, lays like a log.

71
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:45,253
Oh, my lads, do o' spring slapjacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads.

72
00:06:45,233 --> 00:07:13,030
Baked clams and muffins O-D-O-D Spring He's a hundred-barreler Don't lose him now Don't, oh, don't See that yarman Oh, won't ye pull for your duff, my lads Such a sog, such a sogger Don't ye love sperm There goes three thousand dollars, men A bank, a whole bank The Bank of England O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-G

73
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:28,707
At this moment Derek was in the act of pitching his lamp feeder at the advancing boats, and also his oil can, perhaps with the double view of retarding his rival's way, and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.

74
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:31,231
The unmannerly Dutch dogger!

75
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,993
cried Stub.

76
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:37,400
Pull now, men, like fifty thousand line-of-battleship loads of red-haired devils.

77
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:43,949
What you say, Tashtego, are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for the honor of old gayhead?

78
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,514
What you say, I say, pull like God damn!"

79
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:48,656
cried the Indian.

80
00:07:49,537 --> 00:08:00,212
Fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod's three boats now began ranging almost abreast and, so disposed, momentarily neared him.

81
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:05,595
in that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey.

82
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:12,940
The three mates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, There she slides!

83
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,541
Now!

84
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:15,683
Hurrah for the White Ash Breeze!

85
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:17,186
Down with the Yarmen!

86
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:18,467
Sail over him!

87
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:22,313
But so decided, an original start had Derek had.

88
00:08:22,913 --> 00:08:32,747
That spite of all their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman.

89
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:46,246
while this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white ash, and while, in consequence, Derek's boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage, that was a good time for Starbuck, Stub, and Flask.

90
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:52,294
With a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German's quarter.

91
00:08:52,955 --> 00:09:02,228
An instant more, and all four boats were diagonally in the whale's immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he made.

92
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,155
It was a terrific, most pitiable and maddening sight.

93
00:09:07,016 --> 00:09:16,210
The whale was now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet, while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright.

94
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:29,650
Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin.

95
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:37,090
So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks?

96
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:42,103
But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear.

97
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:47,822
But the fear of this vast, dumb brood of the sea was chained up and enchanted in him.

98
00:09:48,623 --> 00:10:05,087
He had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable, while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to apple the stoutest man who so pitied.

99
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:20,173
Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derret chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.

100
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:36,976
But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tigers—Kwekweg, Tashtego, Dagu—instinctively sprang to their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their barbs and darted over the head of the German harpooneer.

101
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:43,225
Their three Nantucket irons entered the whale, blinding vapors of foam and white fire.

102
00:10:43,424 --> 00:10:55,703
The three boats, in the first fury of the whale's headlong rush, bumped the Germans aside with such force that both Derek and his baffled harpooner were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keels.

103
00:10:56,585 --> 00:11:01,973
Don't be afraid, my butterboxes, cried Stubb, casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by.

104
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,299
You'll be picked up presently, all right?

105
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,163
I saw some sharks astern.

106
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:07,045
St.

107
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:09,811
Bernard's dogs, you know, relieve distressed travelers.

108
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:10,793
Hurrah!

109
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,236
This is the way to sail now.

110
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:14,461
Every keel a sunbeam.

111
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:15,283
Hurrah!

112
00:11:15,323 --> 00:11:20,113
Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar.

113
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:24,159
This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tillberry on a plain.

114
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,006
Makes the wheelspokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that way.

115
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:31,391
And there's danger of being pitched out, too, when you strike a hill.

116
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:32,493
Hurrah!

117
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:35,978
This is the way a fellow feels when he's going to Davy Jones.

118
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:39,103
All a rush down an endless inclined plain.

119
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:40,245
Hurrah!

120
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,089
This whale carries the everlasting mail.

121
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:46,675
But the monster's run was a brief one.

122
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,520
giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded.

123
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:56,912
With a grating rush the three lines flew round the lauderheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them.

124
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:03,162
While so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines.

125
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:09,150
That using all their dexterous might, they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at last.

126
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:16,460
Owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue.

127
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,209
The gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high in the air.

128
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:25,304
and the whale soon ceasing to sound.

129
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:31,913
For some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.

130
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:50,800
But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this, holding on, as it is called, this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back, this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes.

131
00:12:50,780 --> 00:13:02,699
Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best, for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stays underwater, the more he is exhausted.

132
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:11,252
Because, owing to the enormous surface of him, in a full-grown sperm whale, something less than two thousand square feet,

133
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:13,135
The pressure of the water is immense.

134
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:21,088
We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under, even here, above ground, in the air.

135
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:27,458
How vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean.

136
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:32,025
It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.

137
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:39,230
One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line of battleships with all their guns and stores and men on board.

138
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:53,912
As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into its eternal blue noon, and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths,

139
00:13:53,892 --> 00:14:02,884
What landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony?

140
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:07,170
Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.

141
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:14,761
Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight-day clock.

142
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:17,164
Suspended, and to what?

143
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:19,427
To three bits of board,

144
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:26,881
Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said, Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?

145
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:41,247
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, The spear, the dart, nor the habergone, He esteemeth iron as straw, The arrow cannot make him flee, Darts are counted as stubble, He loggeth at the shaking of a spear.

146
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,509
This, the creature?

147
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,971
This, he?

148
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:47,677
Oh, that unfulfillments should follow the prophets!

149
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:57,312
For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears.

150
00:14:57,292 --> 00:15:06,650
In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes's army.

151
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:13,343
Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head?

152
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:27,344
"'Stand by, men,' he stirs," cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by magnetic wires the life-and-death throbs of the whale, so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.

153
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:39,702
The next moment, relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small ice-field will, when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.

154
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,022
"'Haul in!

155
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:41,924
Haul in!'

156
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:43,186
cried Starbuck again.

157
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:44,188
"'He's rising!'

158
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:58,032
The lines—of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breath could have been gained—were now in long, quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two ships' lengths of the hunters.

159
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:02,280
His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.

160
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:12,336
In most land animals, there are certain valves or floodgates in many of their veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions.

161
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:28,622
Not so with the whale, one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system.

162
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:36,836
And when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams.

163
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:54,306
Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period, even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernable hills.

164
00:16:54,286 --> 00:17:12,875
Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the new-made wound, which kept continually playing while the natural spout hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the air.

165
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:19,365
From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck.

166
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:23,213
His life, as they significantly call it, was untouched.

167
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:32,431
As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed.

168
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:37,962
His eyes, or rather, the places where his eyes had been, were beheld.

169
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:43,217
as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate.

170
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:51,360
So from the points which the whale's eyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see.

171
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:52,945
but pity there was none.

172
00:17:52,985 --> 00:18:09,906
For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridles and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all.

173
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:18,954
Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discolored bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the flank.

174
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:21,519
A nice spot, cried Flask.

175
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,462
Just let me prick him there once.

176
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:26,287
A vast, cried Starbuck.

177
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,350
There's no need of that.

178
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,441
But humane Starbuck was too late.

179
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:51,254
At the instant of the dart, an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat and marring the bows.

180
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:53,798
It was his deathstroke.

181
00:18:53,778 --> 00:19:12,192
For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made, lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world, turned up the white secrets of his belly, lay like a log, and died.

182
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:16,039
It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.

183
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:25,955
as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the spray column lowers and lowers to the ground.

184
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:29,607
So the last long dying spout of the whale.

185
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:36,457
Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.

186
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:48,456
Immediately, by Starbucks orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so that air-long every boat was a buoy, the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.

187
00:19:48,436 --> 00:20:02,209
By very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffest flupe-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.

188
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:12,809
it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found embedded in his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.

189
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:30,576
But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to denote their place, therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to.

190
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:39,573
But still more curious was the fact of a lancehead of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.

191
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:42,979
Who had darted that stone lance, and when?

192
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,509
It might have been darted by some Norse West Indian long before America was discovered.

193
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,458
What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling.

194
00:20:54,113 --> 00:21:04,010
but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by the ships being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink.

195
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:17,033
However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last, hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the body.

196
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:27,592
Then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable strain upon the timber heads to which the flute chains and cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast them off.

197
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:31,579
Meantime, everything in the Pequod was a slant.

198
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:36,529
To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep, gabled roof of a house.

199
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,613
The ship groaned and gassed.

200
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:45,882
Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation.

201
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:59,119
In vain, hand spikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke chains, to pry them adrift from the timber heads, and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached.

202
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:06,831
while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over.

203
00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:08,595
Hold on, hold on, won't ye?"

204
00:22:09,216 --> 00:22:10,517
cried Stubb to the body.

205
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,300
Don't be in such a devil of a hurry to sink.

206
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,185
By thunder, men, we must do something or go for it.

207
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:18,867
No use prying there.

208
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:25,735
Avast, I say, with your hand-spikes, and run one of ye for a prayer-book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.

209
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:36,868
Aye, aye, cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at the largest floop-chains.

210
00:22:36,848 --> 00:22:41,956
but a few strokes full of sparks were given when the exceeding strain affected the rest.

211
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:48,326
With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift, the ship righted, the carcass sank.

212
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:59,042
Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing, nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it.

213
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:06,967
Usually the dead sperm whale floats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface.

214
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:23,270
If the only whales that thus sank were old, meager, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic, then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish.

215
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:28,017
So sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him,

216
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,930
But it is not so.

217
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:45,027
For young whales, in the highest health and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life, with all their panting lard about them, even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.

218
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:50,795
Be it said, however, that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species.

219
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:54,199
Where one of that sort go down, twenty right whales do.

220
00:23:54,239 --> 00:24:05,154
This difference in the species is no doubt imputable, in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale, his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton.

221
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,719
From this encumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free.

222
00:24:09,256 --> 00:24:16,692
But there are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.

223
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,198
But the reason of this is obvious.

224
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:21,443
Gases are generated in him.

225
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:26,153
He swells to a prodigious magnitude, becomes a sort of animal balloon.

226
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,340
A line of battleship could hardly keep him under then.

227
00:24:29,894 --> 00:24:44,089
In the shore whaling, on soundings among the bays of New Zealand, when a right whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope, so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.

228
00:24:44,221 --> 00:25:01,945
It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequod's mast heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats, though the only spout in sight was that of a finback, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming.

229
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:11,157
Nevertheless, the finback's spout is so similar to the sperm whales that by unskillful fishermen it is often mistaken for it.

230
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:16,836
and consequently Derek and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute.

231
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:25,848
The virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold hopeful chase.

232
00:25:26,932 --> 00:25:27,052
Oh!

233
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:31,086
Many are the Finbacks, and many are the Dereks, my friend.
