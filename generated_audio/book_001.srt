00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,732
Book 1.

2
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:03,959
The Gods in Council Minerva's Visit to Ithaca.

3
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:06,765
The Challenge from Telemachus to the Sweeters.

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:15,103
Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy.

5
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:20,851
Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted.

6
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:29,043
Moreover, he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home, but do what he might.

7
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:37,075
He could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the sun-god Hyperion.

8
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:39,646
So the God prevented them from ever reaching home.

9
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:46,677
Tell me too about all these things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.

10
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:52,567
So now all who escaped death and battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except Ulysses.

11
00:00:53,088 --> 00:01:01,502
And he, though he was longing to return to his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large cave and wanted to marry him.

12
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:06,711
But as years went by, there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca.

13
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:12,681
Even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not yet over.

14
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:20,231
Nevertheless, all the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home.

15
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:29,082
Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who were at the world's end and lie in two halves, the one looking west and the other east.

16
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:37,032
One, he had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying himself at his festival.

17
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:42,939
But the other gods met in the house of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first.

18
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,371
At that moment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon's son Orestes.

19
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:58,328
So he said to the other gods, See now how men lay blame upon us gods for what is, after all, nothing but their own folly.

20
00:01:58,308 --> 00:01:59,269
Look at Aegisthus.

21
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:06,558
He must needs make love to Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew it would be the death of him.

22
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:15,389
For I sent Mercury to warn him not to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home.

23
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,898
Mercury told him this in all good will, but he would not listen, and now he has paid for everything in full.

24
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:32,409
Then Minerva said, Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, it served Agasthys right, and so it would anyone else who does as he did.

25
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:44,464
But Agasthys is neither here nor there, it is for Ulysses that my heart bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-gird island, far away, poor man, from all his friends.

26
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:57,510
It is an island covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder.

27
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:08,545
This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he is tired of life

28
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:12,875
and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys.

29
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:20,854
You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice?

30
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,964
Why, then, should you keep on being so angry with him?

31
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:29,770
And Jove said, My child, what are you talking about?

32
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:39,831
How can I forget Ulysses, than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven?

33
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:47,919
Bear in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes.

34
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:53,464
Polyphemus is son to Neptune by the nymph Thusa, daughter to the sea king Phorcys.

35
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:59,329
Therefore, though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing him from getting home.

36
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:04,073
Still, let us lay our heads together and see how we can help him to return.

37
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:10,138
Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.

38
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:24,128
And Minerva said, Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, if, then, the gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and that he is to return.

39
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:29,261
In the meantime, I will go to Ithaca to put heart into Ulysses' son Telemachus.

40
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:38,577
I will embolden him to call the Achaeans in assembly and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen.

41
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:47,753
I will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos to see if he can hear anything about the return of his dear father, for this will make people speak well of him.

42
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:54,761
So sane she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable, with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea.

43
00:04:55,122 --> 00:05:04,212
She grasped the redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she darted.

44
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:13,183
There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house.

45
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:26,517
Menservants and pages were bustling about to wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of meat.

46
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:30,481
Telemachus saw her long before anyone else did.

47
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:41,432
He was sitting moodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father and how he would send them flying out of the house if he were to come to his own again and be honored as in days gone by.

48
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:50,709
Thus brooding as he sat among them, he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance.

49
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,958
He took her right hand in his own.

50
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:54,780
and bade her give him her spear.

51
00:05:55,581 --> 00:06:01,148
Welcome, said he, to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for.

52
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:04,752
He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him.

53
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:18,709
When they were within, he took her spear and set it in the spear-stand against a strong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a cloth of damask.

54
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:33,036
There was a footstool also for her feet Al-Salsu and two, and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father.

55
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:42,394
A maidservant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them.

56
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:47,604
An upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.

57
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:56,020
The carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side, and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for them.

58
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,644
Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats.

59
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:11,779
Three forthwith men's servants poured water over their hands, maids went round with the bread baskets, pages filled the mixing bowls with wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.

60
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,988
As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet.

61
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,555
So a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce to sing to them.

62
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:32,524
As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing, Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers that no man might hear.

63
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:37,570
I hope, sir, said he, that ye will not be offended with what I am going to say.

64
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:48,062
Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf.

65
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:56,916
If these men were to see my father come back to Ithaca, they would pray for longer legs rather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them.

66
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:05,250
But he, alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is coming, we no longer heed them.

67
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:07,173
We shall never see him again.

68
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:12,902
And now, sir, tell me and tell me true who you are and where you come from."

69
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:23,761
Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves to be, for you cannot have come by land.

70
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:31,535
Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my father's time?

71
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:37,185
In the old days, we had many visitors, for my father went about much himself.

72
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:42,395
Minerva answered, I will tell you truly and particularly all about it.

73
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:46,940
I am Mentes, son of Ankylus, and I am king of the Tafians.

74
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:56,329
I have come here with my ship and crew on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for Temisa IV with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper.

75
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:05,518
As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away from the town, in the harbor Wrythron V under the wooded mountain Neritum.

76
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:06,450
6.

77
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:12,900
Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him.

78
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:26,342
They say, however, that he never comes to town now and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly with an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him when he comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard.

79
00:09:27,352 --> 00:09:36,371
They told me your father was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet, not on the mainland.

80
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:45,310
It is more likely he is on some secret island in mid-ocean, or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will.

81
00:09:45,492 --> 00:10:01,797
I am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much longer, for he is a man of such resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again.

82
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:07,565
But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine-looking fellow for a son?

83
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:17,077
You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also.

84
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:20,542
Since that time we have never either of us seen the other.

85
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:28,813
My mother, answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it is a wise child that knows his own father.

86
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:39,736
would that I were son to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my father.

87
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:46,945
And Minerva said, There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope has such a fine son as you are.

88
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:53,113
But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting and who are these people?

89
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:55,476
What is it all about?

90
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:58,462
Have you some banquet or is there a wedding in the family?

91
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:01,990
For no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own.

92
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:05,778
And the guests, how atrociously they are behaving!

93
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,323
What riot they make over the whole house!

94
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:13,093
It is enough to disgust any respectable person who comes near them.

95
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:27,709
"'Sir,' said Telemachus, "'as regards your question, so long as my father was here, he was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden.

96
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:42,625
I could have borne it better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done, for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown.

97
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,760
But now the storm winds have spirited him away.

98
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,434
We know not whither.

99
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:52,830
He is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but dismay.

100
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,097
Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father.

101
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,623
Heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind.

102
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:14,265
For the chiefs from all our islands, Delicium, Seme, and the woodland island of Zakynthos, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to my mother.

103
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:24,765
who will neither point-blank say that she will not marry seven nor yet bring matters to an end, so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so also with myself."

104
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:26,448
Is that so?"

105
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:27,750
exclaimed Minerva.

106
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:30,335
Then you do indeed want Ulysses home again.

107
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,942
Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances,

108
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:44,738
And if he is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold.

109
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:51,508
He was then coming from Ephira, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Elus, son of Murmurus.

110
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:59,119
Elus feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him.

111
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:04,305
If Ulysses is the man he then was, these suitors will have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.

112
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:12,153
But there, it rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return and take his revenge in his own house or no.

113
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:17,218
I would, however, urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once.

114
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:26,288
Take my advice, call the Achaean heroes and assembly tomorrow morning, lay your case before them, and call heaven to bear you witness.

115
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:30,296
bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his own place.

116
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:42,218
And if your mother's mind is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter may expect.

117
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:52,128
As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest of your father who has so long been missing.

118
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:59,560
Someone may tell you something, or, and people often hear things in this way, some heaven-sent message may direct you.

119
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:07,733
First go to Pylos and ask Nestor, thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans.

120
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:14,698
If you hear that your father is alive and on his way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months.

121
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:25,714
If, on the other hand, you hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry again.

122
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:35,408
Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house.

123
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,952
You are too old to plead infancy any longer.

124
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:43,802
Have you not heard how people are singing Orestes' praises for having killed his father's murderer, Aegisthus?

125
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,727
You are a fine, smart-looking fellow.

126
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:49,812
Show your medal, then, and make yourself a name and story.

127
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:56,984
Now, however, I must go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer.

128
00:14:57,024 --> 00:15:01,311
Think the matter over for yourself and remember what I have said to you.

129
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:09,248
"'Sir,' answered Telemachus, "'it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell me.

130
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:16,363
I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself.'"

131
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:20,429
I will then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing.

132
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,960
I will give you one of great beauty and value, a keepsake such as only dear friends give to one another."

133
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:31,928
Minerva answered, "'Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at once.

134
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:38,538
As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till I come again, and I will take it home with me.

135
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:44,207
You shall give me a very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in return."

136
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:53,247
With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had given Telemachus courage and had made him think more than ever about his father.

137
00:15:54,090 --> 00:16:01,369
He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were sitting.

138
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:11,041
Phineas was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the sad tale of the return from Troy and the ills Minerva had laid upon the Achaeans.

139
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:21,754
Penelope, daughter of Icarus, heard his song from her room upstairs and came down by the great staircase, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids.

140
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:29,386
When she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloister's eight with a stayed maiden on either side of her.

141
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:33,352
She held a veil moreover before her face and was weeping bitterly.

142
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:40,063
Femius, she cried, you know many another feat of gods and heroes such as poets love to celebrate.

143
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:44,433
Sing the suitors some one of these, and let them drink their wine in silence.

144
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:56,922
But cease this sad tale, for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas and Middle Argos.

145
00:16:56,902 --> 00:16:57,543
9.

146
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:02,373
Mother, answered Telemachus, let the bards sing what he has a mind to.

147
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:05,179
Bards do not make the ills they sing of.

148
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:13,797
It is Jove, not they, who makes them, and who sends wail or woe upon mankind according to his own good pleasure.

149
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:21,007
This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of the Danons, for people always applaud the latest songs most warmly.

150
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:23,129
Make up your mind to it and bear it.

151
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,857
Ulysses is not the only man who never came back from Troy, but many another went down as well as he.

152
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:36,727
Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants.

153
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:40,152
For speech is man's matter, and mine above all others.

154
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:43,176
Ten, for it is I who am master here.

155
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:47,614
She went wandering back into the house and laid her son's saying in her heart.

156
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:55,048
Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes.

157
00:17:55,709 --> 00:18:02,481
But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered Cloister's Eleven, and prayed each one that he might be her bedfellow.

158
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,823
Then Telemachus spoke.

159
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:15,637
Shameless, he cried, and insolent suitors, let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has.

160
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:25,429
But in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal notice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and turn about, at your own cost.

161
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:31,236
If on the other hand you choose to persist in sponging upon one man, heaven help me,

162
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:37,561
but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge you."

163
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:43,049
The suitors bit their lips as they heard him and marveled at the boldness of his speech.

164
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:50,681
Then Antinous, son of Eupathes, said, The gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall-talking.

165
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:55,789
May Jove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before you.

166
00:18:56,478 --> 00:19:03,575
Telemachus answered, Antinous, do not chide with me, but, God willing, I will be chief too if I can.

167
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:06,943
Is this the worst fate you can think of for me?

168
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:13,018
It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and honor.

169
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,870
Still, now that Ulysses is dead, there are many great men in Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them.

170
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:25,559
Nevertheless, I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom Ulysses has won for me."

171
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:37,217
Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, It rests with heaven to decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own house and over your own possessions.

172
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:41,181
No one while there is a man in Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you.

173
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:45,225
And now, my good fellow, I want to know about this stranger.

174
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,407
What country does he come from?

175
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:50,790
Of what family is he, and where is his estate?

176
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:56,015
Has he brought you news about the return of your father, or was he on business of his own?

177
00:19:56,075 --> 00:20:03,222
He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know him.

178
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:10,688
My father is dead and gone, answered Telemachus, and even if some rumor reaches me, I put no more faith in it now.

179
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:17,937
My mother does indeed sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophesyings no heed.

180
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:24,664
As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father's.

181
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:27,647
But in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.

182
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:31,892
The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening.

183
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:36,542
But when night fell upon their pleasuring, they went home to bed each in his own abode.

184
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:42,534
Twelve Telemachus's room was high up in a tower 113 that looked on to the outer court.

185
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:46,422
Hither then he hide, brooding and full of thought.

186
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:53,258
A good old woman, Eurycleia, daughter of Ops the son of Pisnor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches.

187
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,145
Laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young.

188
00:20:57,786 --> 00:21:05,338
He gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and showed as much respect to her in his household as he did to his own wedded wife.

189
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:08,926
But he did not take her to his bed for he feared his wife's resentment.

190
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:10,730
Fourteen.

191
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:20,391
She it was who now lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a baby.

192
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:23,374
He opened the door of his bedroom and sat down upon the bed.

193
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:37,950
As he took off his shirt fifteen he gave it to the good old woman, who folded it tidily up and hung it for him over a peg by his bedside, after which she went out, pulled the door to, by a silver catch, and drew the bold home by means of the strap.

194
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:39,672
One sixteen.

195
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:48,842
But Telemachus as he lay covered with a woolen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage and of the counsel that Minerva had given him.
