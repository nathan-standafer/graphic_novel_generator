00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:18,345
Chapter 127 - The Deck. The coffin laid upon two line-tubes between the vice, vench and the open, hatchway the carpenter caulking its seams, the string of twisted, oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock.

2
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:23,254
Ahab comes slowly from the cabin gangway and hears Pip following him.

3
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:26,808
The cabin gangway, and here's Pip following him.

4
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:29,693
Back, lad, I will be with ye again presently.

5
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:30,495
He goes.

6
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:34,422
Not this hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy.

7
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,205
Middle aisle of a church.

8
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:37,327
What's here?

9
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:38,809
Lifebuoy, sir.

10
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,893
Mr. Starbucks orders.

11
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:42,336
Oh, look, sir.

12
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:43,778
Beware the hatchway.

13
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,660
Thank ye, man.

14
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:47,605
Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.

15
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:47,966
Sir?

16
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:49,229
The hatchway?

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:49,990
Oh!

18
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:52,296
So it does, sir, so it does.

19
00:00:52,997 --> 00:00:54,441
Art not thou the leg-maker?

20
00:00:54,942 --> 00:00:57,327
Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?

21
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:58,951
I believe it did, sir.

22
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,795
Does the fair rule stand, sir?

23
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:02,018
Well enough.

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,205
But art thou not also the undertaker?

25
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:11,955
Aye, sir, I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg, but they've set me now to turning it into something else.

26
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:26,637
Then tell me, art thou not an errant, all-grasping, intermeddling, monopolizing, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins?

27
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:31,292
Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a jack-of-all-trades.

28
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:33,595
But I do not mean anything, sir.

29
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:35,197
I do as I do.

30
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:37,019
The gods again.

31
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:41,184
Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin?

32
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:50,154
The titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes, and the gravedigger in the play sings, spade in hand.

33
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:51,536
Dost thou never?

34
00:01:52,497 --> 00:01:53,018
Sing, sir.

35
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:54,700
Do I sing, sir?

36
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:56,742
Do I sing?

37
00:01:56,722 --> 00:01:58,825
Oh, I'm indifferent enough, sir, for that.

38
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:04,431
But the reason why the gravedigger made music must have been because there was none in his spade, sir.

39
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:06,754
But the caulking mallet is full of it.

40
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:07,875
Hark to it!

41
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:14,363
Ay, and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board, and what in all things makes the sounding-board is this.

42
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:15,805
There's naught beneath.

43
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:20,991
And yet a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, carpenter.

44
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:26,760
Hast thou ever helped carry a beer and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate going in?

45
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,024
Faith, sir, I've— Faith?

46
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:29,765
What's that?

47
00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:31,387
Why, faith, sir.

48
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:34,593
It's only a sort of exclamation like, that's all, sir.

49
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:36,415
Um, um, go on.

50
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:39,300
I was about to say, sir, that—

51
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:40,599
Art thou a silkworm?

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,443
Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?

53
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:44,684
Look at thy bosom.

54
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:47,427
Dispatch, and get these traps out of sight.

55
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:50,951
He goes aft, and get these traps out of sight.

56
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,396
That was sudden now, but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes.

57
00:02:55,937 --> 00:03:01,643
I've heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the Gallipagos, is cut by the equator right in the middle.

58
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:05,709
Seems to me some sort of equator cuts yon old man too, right in his middle.

59
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,794
He's always under the line fiery hot, I tell ya.

60
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,376
He's looking this way.

61
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:12,900
Come, Oakum, quick, here we go again.

62
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,487
This wooden mallet is the cork, and I'm the professor of musical glasses.

63
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,470
Tap, tap, to himself.

64
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:22,214
There's a sight, there's a sound.

65
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:26,601
The gray-headed woodpecker tapping the hollow tree.

66
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,004
Blind and dumb might well be envied now.

67
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:33,550
See, that thing rests on two line-tubs full of toe-lines.

68
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,133
A most malicious wag, that fellow.

69
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:37,334
Rat-tat.

70
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:40,418
So man's seconds tick.

71
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:42,901
Oh, how immaterial are all materials!

72
00:03:43,302 --> 00:03:46,005
What things real are there but imponderable thoughts?

73
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:56,098
Here now's the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life.

74
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:57,682
A life buoy of a coffin.

75
00:03:58,403 --> 00:03:59,265
Does it go further?

76
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:05,559
Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality preserver?

77
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,662
I'll think of that.

78
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:07,844
But no.

79
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:16,163
So far gone am I in the dark side of Earth that its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me.

80
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:19,215
Will ye never have done, carpenter, with that accursed sound?

81
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,211
I go below, let me not see that thing here when I return again.

82
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:25,600
Now then, Pip, we'll talk this over.

83
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,351
I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee.

84
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:32,768
Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee.
