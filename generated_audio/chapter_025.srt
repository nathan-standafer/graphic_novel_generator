CHAPTER XXV.

00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:02,655
POSTSCRIPT.

3
00:00:02,675 --> 00:00:07,562
In behalf of the dignity of Whaling, I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts.

4
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:21,583
But after embattling his facts, an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell eloquently upon his cause such an advocate, would he not be blameworthy?

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:31,899
It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through.

6
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:38,449
There is a salt-cellar of state, so called, and there may be a caster of state.

7
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,255
How they use the salt, precisely, who knows?

8
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:49,370
Certain I am, however, that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad.

9
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:57,367
Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery?

10
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,451
Much might be ruminated here.

11
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:12,283
concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing.

12
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:15,972
In truth a mature man who uses hair oil.

13
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:20,885
Unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quaggy spot in him somewhere.

14
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:24,976
As a general rule, he can't amount to much in his totality.

15
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:31,513
But the only thing to be considered here, is this what kind of oil is used at coronations?

16
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:39,592
Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.

17
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:47,370
What then can it possibly be, but sperm-oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?

18
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:49,976
Think of that, ye loyal Britons!

19
00:01:50,638 --> 00:01:55,088
We whale-men supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff.
