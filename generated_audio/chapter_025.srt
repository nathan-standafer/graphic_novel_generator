Chapter 25 - Postscript. In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts.

2
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:20,588
But after embattling his facts, an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell eloquently upon his cause, such an advocate, would he not be blameworthy?

3
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:29,079
It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through.

4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,005
There is a salt cellar of state, so called, and there may be a caster of state.

5
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:36,809
How they use the salt, precisely.

6
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:44,719
Who knows, certain I am, however, that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad.

7
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:50,610
Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint machinery?

8
00:00:51,471 --> 00:01:04,710
Much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably smells of that anointing.

9
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:13,542
In truth, a mature man who uses hair oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quaggy spot in him somewhere.

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,144
As a general rule, he can't amount to much in his totality.

11
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:19,926
But the only thing to be considered here is this.

12
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:22,869
What kind of oil is used at coronations?

13
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:30,978
Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod liver oil.

14
00:01:31,398 --> 00:01:38,365
What then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?

15
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:40,094
Think of that, ye loyal Britons.

16
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:44,136
We whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff.
