CHAPTER I. HUTSA PORPOISE.DWILD PORPOISE.

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:08,100
This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe.

3
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:15,409
The name is of my own bestowal, for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something must be done to distinguish them.

4
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:27,743
I call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth of July crowd.

5
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:31,409
Their appearance is generally hailed with the delight by the mariner.

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,419
Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,805
They are the lads that always lived before the wind.

8
00:00:41,346 --> 00:00:43,089
They are accounted a lucky omen.

9
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:49,399
If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye.

10
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,967
The spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye.

11
00:00:53,947 --> 00:01:04,484
A well-fed plump Huzzah porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil, but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable.

12
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:08,250
It is in request among jewelers and watchmakers.

13
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,714
Sailors put it on their hones.

14
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:13,278
Porpoise meat is good eating, you know.

15
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:17,004
It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts.

16
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,051
Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible.

17
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:27,535
But the next time you have a chance, watch him, and you will then see the great Sperm Whale himself in miniature.

18
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:29,398
BOOK III.

19
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,481
DUODICIMO CHAPTER II.

20
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,524
OLGERINE PORPUS DOT.

21
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:34,646
A pirate.

22
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:35,807
Very savage.

23
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:38,271
He is only found, I think, in the Pacific.

24
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:43,158
He is somewhat larger than the Husiporpus, but much of the same general make.

25
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:46,143
Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark.

26
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:51,190
I have lowered for him many times, but never yet saw him captured.

27
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:53,293
Book 3.

28
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:54,655
Duodecimo.

29
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:55,456
Chapter 3.

30
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:56,277
Mealy Mouth.

31
00:01:56,837 --> 00:01:57,298
Porpoise.

32
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,086
The largest kind of porpoise, and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is known.

33
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:16,283
The only English name by which he has hitherto been designated is that of the fisher's right whale porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio.

34
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:23,932
In shape, he differs in some degree from the Husa porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth, indeed.

35
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:27,477
He is of quite a neat and gentlemanlike figure.

36
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:31,662
He has no fins on his back, most other porpoises have.

37
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:36,668
He has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue.

38
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,873
But his mealy mouth spoils all.

39
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:56,310
Though his entire back down to his side fins as of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called the bright waist, that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colors, black above and white below.

40
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:05,580
The white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag.

41
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,724
A most mean and mealy aspect.

42
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:12,848
His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.

43
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:19,936
Beyond the duodecimo this system does not proceed inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales.

44
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:23,580
Above you have all the leviathans of note.

45
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:42,193
But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally, I shall enumerate them by their forecastle appellations, for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators.

46
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:45,300
who may complete what I have here but begun.

47
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:57,045
If any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into this system, according to his folio, octavo, or du decimo, magnitude curg.

48
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:58,087
The Bottlenose Whale.

49
00:03:58,668 --> 00:03:59,490
The Junk Whale.

50
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:14,543
The pudding-headed whale, The cape whale, The leading whale, The cannon whale, The scrag whale, Scrag while, The coppered whale, To elephant, The sugrock, Pewdie-quag-glill, Whale, the anthrust,

51
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:34,945
From Icelandic, Dutch, and Old English authorities there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names, but I admit them as altogether obsolete, and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of leviathanism, with signifying nothing.

52
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:41,910
Finally, he quote, it was stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected.

53
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,800
You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word.

54
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:58,392
But I now leave my pseudological system, standing thus unfinished, even as the great cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.

55
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:06,342
For small erections may be finished by their first architects' grand ones, true ones, ever lead the copestone to posterity.

56
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:09,206
God keep me from ever completing anything.

57
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:14,753
This whole book is but a draft, nay, but the draft of a draft.

58
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:18,398
All time, strength, cash and patience.
