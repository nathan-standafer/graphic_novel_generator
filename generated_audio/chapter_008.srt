CHAPTER VIII.

2
00:00:01,073 --> 00:00:01,573
THE POLKET.

3
00:00:01,693 --> 00:00:11,868
I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered, immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:20,701
A quick, regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain.

5
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:27,912
Yes, it was the famous Father Mupple, so called by the wellmen, among whom he was a very great favorite.

6
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:36,646
He had been a sailor and a haupenier in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry.

7
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:50,187
At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age, that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles

8
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:58,761
there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom, the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February's snow.

9
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:12,985
No one, having previously heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him.

10
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:17,031
imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led.

11
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:36,542
When he entered, I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot-cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed.

12
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:43,996
However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner.

13
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:58,564
When, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit, like most old-fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one, and since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,

14
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:02,414
Seriously contract the already small area of the chapel.

15
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:13,684
The architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder.

16
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:17,191
like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.

17
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:31,437
The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which being itself nicely headed and stained with a mahogany colour,

18
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:38,485
The whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste.

19
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:54,184
Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mopple cast a look upwards, and then, with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity,

20
00:02:54,164 --> 00:03:00,254
hand over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main top of his vessel.

21
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:07,926
The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope.

22
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:13,394
Only the rounds were of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.

23
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:20,205
At my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship

24
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:42,319
These joints, in the present instance, seemed unnecessary, for I was not prepared to see Father Mothel, after gaining the height, slowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step till the hole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.

25
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:46,125
I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.

26
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:58,152
Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage.

27
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:03,397
No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing, furthermore.

28
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:06,120
It must symbolize something unseen.

29
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:14,087
Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time?

30
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:29,106
Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit I see, is a self-containing stronghold alofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.

31
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:33,713
But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place.

32
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:37,298
Borrowed from the chaplains' former seafarings.

33
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:54,284
Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers.

34
00:04:54,444 --> 00:05:00,713
But high above the flying scud and dark rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight

35
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:15,613
from which beamed forth an angel's face, and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the victory's plank where Nelson fell.

36
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,378
Noble ship!"

37
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:19,380
angels seemed to say.

38
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:20,503
Beton!

39
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,444
Beton!

40
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:24,711
Thou noble ship, and bear a hearty helm for lo!

41
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:30,002
The sun is breaking through, the clouds are rolling off serenest azures at hand.

42
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:37,517
Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved the latter and the picture.

43
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:49,734
Its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll-work, fashioned after a ship's fiddle-headed beak.

44
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:51,497
What could be more full of meaning?

45
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:55,482
For the pulpit is ever, this earth's foremost part.

46
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,505
All the rest comes in its rear.

47
00:05:58,126 --> 00:06:00,349
The pulpit leads the world.

48
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:07,585
From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is first described, And the bow must bear the earliest brunt.

49
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:13,959
From thence it is the god of breezes fair or foul Is first invoked for favourable winds.

50
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:21,595
Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, And not a voyage complete, and the pulpit is its prow.
