CHAPTER XXI.

2
00:00:01,393 --> 00:00:08,881
GOING ABOARD IT was nearly six o'clock, but only grey and perfect misty dawn, when we drew nigh the wharf.

3
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:13,526
"'There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,' said Adequique.

4
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:15,008
"'It can't be shadows.

5
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:17,070
She's off by sunrise, I guess.

6
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:17,631
Come on!'

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:18,893
"'Avast!'

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:28,063
cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us.

9
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:34,655
stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me.

10
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:36,498
It was Elijah.

11
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:38,542
Going aboard?

12
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:39,764
Hands off, will you?

13
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:41,968
said I. Lookie here!

14
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:44,072
said Queequeg, shaking himself.

15
00:00:44,553 --> 00:00:45,234
Go away!

16
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,997
Ain't going aboard, then?

17
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:51,614
"'Yes, we are,' said I, "'but what business is that of yours?

18
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:55,799
Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?'

19
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:05,670
"'No, no, I wasn't aware of that,' said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Kwee Kweg, with the most unaccountable glances.

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,656
"'Elijah,' said I, "'you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing.'

21
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:15,068
We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans and would prefer not to be detained.

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,952
Yea be, B.G.

23
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:22,587
Coming back a full breakfast?"

24
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:24,556
"'Hullo!'

25
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:28,582
cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few paces.

26
00:01:28,602 --> 00:01:31,506
"'Never mind him,' said I, queequeg.

27
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:32,267
"'Come on!'

28
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:43,342
But he stole up to us again, and suddenly, clapping his hand on my shoulder, said, "'Did you see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?'

29
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,926
struck by this plain matter-of-fact question.

30
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:52,675
I answered, saying, "'Yes, I thought I did see four or five men, but it was too dim to be sure.

31
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:56,783
Very dim, very dim, said Elijah, mourning to ye.

32
00:01:56,823 --> 00:02:05,159
Once more we quitted him, but once more he came softly after us, and touching my shoulder again, said, See if you can find him now, will ye?

33
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:06,722
Find who?

34
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:08,385
Mourning to ye.

35
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:12,110
Mourning to ye," he rejoined, again moving off.

36
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,033
"'Oh, I was going to warn ye against.

37
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:18,036
But never mind, never mind, it's all one.

38
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:19,378
All in the family.

39
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,360
Too sharp frost this morning, ain't it?

40
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:22,982
Good-bye to you.

41
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,405
Shan't see ye again very soon.

42
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,847
I guess it's before the grand jury."

43
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:37,478
And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.

44
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:44,832
At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound quiet, not a soul moving.

45
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:51,084
The cabin entrance was locked within the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.

46
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:56,715
Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open.

47
00:02:56,695 --> 00:03:03,828
Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket.

48
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:10,440
He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face downwards and enclosed in his folded arms.

49
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:14,046
The profoundest slumber slept upon him.

50
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:18,454
Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?"

51
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:21,238
said I, looking dubiously at the sleeper.

52
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:32,558
But it seemed that, when on the wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to, hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter,

53
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:36,882
Were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question.

54
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:41,066
But I'd beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper.

55
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:50,175
Jocularly hinted to Queequeg that, perhaps we had best sit up with the body, telling him to establish himself accordingly.

56
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:58,283
He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough, and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.

57
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:02,207
Gracious, Queequeg don't sit there, said I.

58
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:04,670
"'Oh, peridude seat,' said Quirreg.

59
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,152
"'My country way won't hurt him face.'

60
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:08,694
"'Face!'

61
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:09,775
said I.

62
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:11,156
"'Call that his face?'

63
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:14,600
"'Very benevolent countenance, then.

64
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,362
But how hard he breathes!

65
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:18,003
He's heaving himself.

66
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:19,405
Get off, Queequeg.

67
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:20,306
You are heavy.

68
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:22,348
It's grinding the face of the poor.

69
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,929
Get off, Queequeg.

70
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,851
Look, he'll twitch you off soon.

71
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:27,553
I wonder he don't we?'

72
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:33,093
Kwee Kweg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe.

73
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:35,502
I sat at the feet.

74
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:40,433
We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.

75
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:59,481
Meanwhile, upon questioning him in his broken fashion, Cuique gave me to understand that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for Ottomans for

76
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:10,231
Ottomans, and, to furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves.

77
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:17,807
Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion, much better than those garden chairs which are convertible,

78
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:30,227
into walking-sticks upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading-tree, perhaps in some damp, marshy place.

79
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:37,927
While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper's head.

80
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:40,591
What's that for, Queequeg?

81
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,136
Peri-easy, kill-o!

82
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:44,538
Peri-easy!

83
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:56,637
He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe, which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul.

84
00:05:56,617 --> 00:06:05,068
When we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigour, the strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon him.

85
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:14,601
He breathed with a sort of muffledness, then seemed troubled in the nose, then revolved over once or twice, then sat up and rubbed his eyes.

86
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:18,005
He breathed at last.

87
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:19,527
Who be ye, smokers?

88
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:23,873
Shipped men, answered I. When does she sail?

89
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:25,806
Ah, here going in her?

90
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:27,852
B. She sails to-day.

91
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:30,158
The captain came aboard last night.

92
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,342
What captain?

93
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:32,285
Ahab.

94
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:38,503
Who but him and D. I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we heard a noise on deck.

95
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:40,036
"'Ha, lol!

96
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:42,318
Starbuck's a steer,' said the rigger.

97
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:49,285
"'He's a lively chief mate, that god-man, and a pious, but all alive now I must turn to.'"

98
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:52,888
And so saying, he went on deck, and we followed.

99
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:54,590
It was now clear sunrise.

100
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:59,635
Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes, the riggers bestirred themselves.

101
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:02,158
The mates were actively engaged.

102
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:08,524
And several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board.

103
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:13,418
Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin.
