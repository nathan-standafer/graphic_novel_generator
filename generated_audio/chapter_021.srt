00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:10,075
Chapter 21 - Going Aboard. It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf.

2
00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:14,498
There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right," said I to Queequeg.

3
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,060
It can't be shadows.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,722
She's off by sunrise, I guess.

5
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:18,584
Come on!

6
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:19,845
Avast!

7
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:33,885
cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me.

8
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:36,027
It was Elijah, going aboard.

9
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:37,348
"'Hands off, will you?'

10
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:37,909
said I.

11
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:40,792
"'Looky here,' said Queequeg, shaking himself.

12
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:41,493
"'Go away.

13
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:42,834
Ain't going aboard, then?'

14
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:44,616
"'Yes, we are,' said I.

15
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:45,336
"'But wait.

16
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:47,058
Ain't going aboard, then?'

17
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:48,980
"'Yes, we are,' said I.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,982
"'But what business is that of yours?

19
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,485
Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?'

20
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:56,067
"'No, no, no.

21
00:00:56,307 --> 00:01:03,214
I wasn't aware of that,' said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg with the most unaccountable glances.

22
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:07,286
"'Elijah,' said I, "'you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing.

23
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:11,630
"'We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans "'and would prefer not to be detained.

24
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:15,134
"'Ye be, be ye, coming back afore breakfast.'

25
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:18,777
"'He's cracked, Queequeg,' said I, "'coming back afore breakfast.'

26
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:26,625
"'He's cracked, Queequeg,' said I, "'come on,' cried stationary Elijah, "'hailing us when we had removed a few paces.

27
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:30,248
"'Never mind him,' said I, "'Queequeg, come on.'

28
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:39,782
But he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder said, did you see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?

29
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:48,439
Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, Yes, I thought I did see four or five men, but it was too dim to be sure.

30
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,984
Very dim, very dim, said Elijah.

31
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:53,206
Mourning to ye.

32
00:01:53,246 --> 00:02:01,478
Once more we quitted him, but once more he came softly after us, and touching my shoulder again, said, See if you can find him now, will ye?

33
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:02,219
Find who?

34
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:07,727
Mourning to ye, mourning to ye, mourning to ye, he rejoined, again moving off.

35
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:12,453
Oh, I was going to warn ye against, but never mind, never mind, never mind.

36
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:14,937
It's all one, all in the family, too.

37
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:16,859
Sharp frost this morning, ain't it?

38
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,921
Goodbye to ye.

39
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:22,767
Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess, unless it's before the grand jury."

40
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:31,459
And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.

41
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:37,647
At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound quiet, not a soul moving.

42
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:43,215
The cabin entrance was locked within, the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.

43
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:47,560
Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open.

44
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:54,128
Seeing a light, we went down and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered pea jacket.

45
00:02:54,889 --> 00:03:00,235
He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face downwards and enclosed in his folded arms.

46
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:03,178
The profoundest slumber slept upon him.

47
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:07,942
Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?"

48
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:10,245
said I, looking dubiously at the sleeper.

49
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:15,952
But it seemed that, when on the wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to.

50
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:23,682
Hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question.

51
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:33,456
But I beat the thing down, and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body, telling him to establish himself accordingly.

52
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:41,544
He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough, and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.

53
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:42,766
Gracious.

54
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:48,191
Queequeg, don't sit there, said I. Oh, parry dude's seat, said Queequeg.

55
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:50,193
My country way won't hurt him face.

56
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:53,837
Face, said I. Call that his face?

57
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:58,285
Very benevolent countenance then, but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself.

58
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:02,051
Get off, Queequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor.

59
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:04,515
Queequeg, you are heavy, it's gree.

60
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:05,958
Get off, Queequeg.

61
00:04:06,398 --> 00:04:07,761
Look, he'll twitch you off soon.

62
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:09,784
I wonder he don't wake.

63
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:14,350
Cui Cueg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe.

64
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:15,832
I sat at the feet.

65
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:19,116
We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other.

66
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:36,278
Meanwhile, upon questioning him in his broken fashion, Cui Cueg gave me to understand that, in his land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for Ottomans.

67
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:43,828
and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers and alcoves.

68
00:04:44,429 --> 00:05:01,152
Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion, much better than those garden chairs which are convertible into walking-sticks, upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.

69
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:08,735
While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet side of it over the sleeper's head.

70
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:10,478
What's that for, Queequeg?

71
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:11,880
Peri-easy!

72
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:12,942
Kili-oh!

73
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:13,943
Peri-easy!

74
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:27,325
He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk pipe, which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger.

75
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,257
The strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon him.

76
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:40,891
He breathed with a sort of muffledness, then seemed troubled in the nose, then revolved over once or twice, then sat up and rubbed his eyes.

77
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:42,333
Halloa!

78
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:44,296
he breathed at last.

79
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:45,838
Who be, smokers?

80
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,324
Shipped men, answered I. When does she sail?

81
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:52,048
Aye, aye, ye are going in her be.

82
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,310
She sails to-day.

83
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,894
The captain came aboard last night.

84
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,021
What captain?

85
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:57,762
Ahab.

86
00:05:58,123 --> 00:05:59,205
Who but him indeed?

87
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:04,935
I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab when we heard a noise on deck.

88
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:05,857
Halloa!

89
00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:08,001
Starbuck's a stir, said the rigger.

90
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:13,731
He's a lively chief mate that, good man, and a pious, but all alive now I must turn to.

91
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:17,578
And so saying, he went on deck, and we followed.

92
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,122
It was now clear sunrise.

93
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,294
Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes.

94
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:30,964
The riggers bestirred themselves, the mates were actively engaged, and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board.

95
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:35,601
Meanwhile, Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin.
