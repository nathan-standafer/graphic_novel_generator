00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,892
CHAPTER XXX.

2
00:00:01,593 --> 00:00:02,694
MIDNIGHT FOR KISSLE.

3
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:04,557
HARPOONIERS AND SAILORS.

4
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:06,940
FORSAIL, RISES AND DISCOVERS.

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,207
THE WATCH STANDING, LOUNGING, LEANING AND LYING IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES, ALL SINGING IN CHORUS.

6
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:16,291
FAREWELL AND ADIEU TO YOU, SPANISH LADIES.

7
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:19,095
FAREWELL AND ADIEU TO YOU, LADIES OF SPAIN.

8
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:20,617
OUR CAPTAINS COMMANDED.

9
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:22,819
ONCE, DENOUNCE THE KIT SAILOR.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,544
O boys, don't be sentimental, it's bad for the digestion.

11
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:29,768
Take a tonic, follow me.

12
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:30,749
And all follow.

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,777
Our captain stood upon the deck, A spy-glass in his hand, A viewing of those gallant whales That blew at every strand.

14
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:47,847
O your tubs in your boats, my boys, And by your braces stand, And we'll have one of those fine whales, Hand, boys, over.

15
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:51,691
Eight bells there, forward, To and dee, nay, and tuck it, sailor.

16
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:56,616
Avast the chorus, eight bells there, Be here, bell-boy,

17
00:00:56,596 --> 00:01:00,861
Strike the bell eight thou pip, thou blackling, And let me call the watch.

18
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:05,085
I've the sort of mouth For that the hog's-head mouth."

19
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,208
So-so thrust his head down the scuttle.

20
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:10,511
Starbowley in said A-H-O-Y.

21
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,335
Eight bells there below tumble up.

22
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:18,060
Dutch sailor, grand snoozing to-night, Met thaw night for that.

23
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:23,506
I mark this in our old Mughal's wine, It's quite as deadening to some as filibing to others.

24
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:25,388
We sing thee sleep by.

25
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:29,692
Lie down there, like ground-tear butts, At M. again.

26
00:01:29,712 --> 00:01:33,275
There take this copper pump, And hail M. through it.

27
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:36,278
Tell M. to avast Dreaming of their lassies.

28
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:38,440
Tell M. it's the resurrection.

29
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:42,184
They must kiss their last, And come to judgment.

30
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:46,248
That's the way that's, if thy throat ain't Spoiled with eating Amsterdam butter.

31
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:53,495
French sailor, Hist, boys, let's have a jig or two Before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay.

32
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:54,936
What say ye?

33
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:57,248
There comes the other watch.

34
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:58,730
Stand by all legs.

35
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,113
Pip, little Pip, Hurrah with your tambourine.

36
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:05,957
Pip, salky and sleepy, Don't know where it is.

37
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:09,561
French sailor, Beat thy belly then and wag thy ears.

38
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,644
Jigot, men, I say Mary's the word, Gerard.

39
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:14,405
Damn me, won't you dance?

40
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:18,069
Form, now, Indian file, And gallop into the double shuffle.

41
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:19,170
Throw yourselves.

42
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,273
Legs, legs, Iceland's sailor.

43
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:23,798
I don't like your flour-meaty.

44
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,480
It's too springy to my taste.

45
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,042
I'm used to ice floors.

46
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:30,706
I'm sorry to throw cold water on the subject, but excuse me."

47
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:32,248
Maltese Sailor.

48
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:33,389
Me too.

49
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,591
Where's the girls?

50
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:41,279
Who but a fool would take his left hand by his right, and say to himself, How d'ye do?

51
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,522
Partners, I must have partners.

52
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:44,963
Sicilian Sailor.

53
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:46,826
I'd girls in the green.

54
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:49,729
Then I'll hop with you or turn grasshopper.

55
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,231
Long Island Sailor.

56
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:54,792
Well, well, you salkies, there's plenty more of us.

57
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:59,415
Hold corn when you may, say I. All eggs go to harvest soon.

58
00:02:59,615 --> 00:03:10,012
The half of them dance to the tambourine, Some go below, some sleep or lie, Among the coils of rigging, Oaths aplenty, azure sailor.

59
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:18,265
Go it, Pip, bang it, bellboy, Rig it, dick it, stick it, quick it, bellboy, Make fireflies, break the jinglers, Pip.

60
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:19,507
Jinglers, you say?

61
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:22,973
There goes another, Dropped off, I pounded so.

62
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:28,820
China sailor, rattle thy teeth then, and pound away, of make a pagoda of thyself.

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,904
French sailor, merry mad, hold up thy hoopip till I jump through it.

64
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,327
Split jibs, tear yourselves.

65
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:38,351
Tesso, quake thee, smoking.

66
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:39,993
That's a white man.

67
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:41,454
He calls that Funko.

68
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:42,335
Humph!

69
00:03:42,696 --> 00:03:43,657
I sieve my sweat.

70
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:49,163
Old men sailor, I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over.

71
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:56,514
I'll dance over your grave, I will, that's the bitterest threat Of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners.

72
00:03:57,855 --> 00:04:02,562
O Christ, to think of the green navies, And the green-skulled crews!

73
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:09,252
Well, well, belight the whole world's a ball, As you scholars have it, and so tis right To make one ballroom of it.

74
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:16,382
Dance on, lads, your youngin' I was once, 3-D Nantucket sailor, spell O-hoo!

75
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:20,474
This is worse than pulling after whales in a calm gibbous.

76
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:21,360
Awith, Tash.

77
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:24,252
Cayce sees dancing and gathering clusters.

78
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,355
Meantime, the sky darkens, the wind rises.

79
00:04:27,815 --> 00:04:32,420
Lasker Sailor By Brahma, boys, it'll be thou sail soon.

80
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:35,543
The sky-borne Haitha again just turned to wind.

81
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:40,669
Thou show'st thy black brow, Siva, Maltese Sailor, and shaking his cap.

82
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:44,513
But it's the waves the snow's caps turned a-jigget now.

83
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:46,695
They'll shake their tassels soon.

84
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:49,778
Now would all the waves were women.

85
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:53,766
Then I'd go drown, and chassis with them evermore.

86
00:04:53,986 --> 00:05:05,609
There's not so sweet on earth heaven may not match it, As those swift glances of warm wild bosoms in the dance, When the over-arbouring arms hide such right bursting grapes.

87
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,977
Sicilian sailor, reclining, tell me not of it.

88
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:19,805
Hark ye, lad fleet, interlacings of the Limbs-lide, swayings, coings, flutterings, Lip, heart, hip, all grace, o'er unceasing touch and go.

89
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:23,472
La taste, observe ye, else come satiety.

90
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:31,628
Ay, pagan, Nuging, Tahitian sailor, reclining on a man, Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls, Ahiva-hiva!

91
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:45,435
All low-veiled, high-palmed Tahiti, I still rest me on thy mat, But the soft soil has slid, I saw thee woven in the wood my mat, Green the first day I brought ye thence, Now worn and wilted quite.

92
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:48,621
Ah me not thou, nor I can bear the change.

93
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:51,811
How then, if so, be transplanted to yon sky?

94
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:59,619
Here are the roaring streams from Pyrohede's peak of spears, When they leap down the crags and drown the villages.

95
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,026
The blast, the blast, upspine and meet it, Leaps to his feet, courted you sailor.

96
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:12,112
How the sea rolls, swashing gains the side, Stand by for reefing hearties.

97
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:16,937
The winds are just crossing swords, Pelmel they'll go lunging presently.

98
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:22,305
Danish sailor, Crack, crack, hold ship, so long as thou crackest, thou holdest.

99
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:23,386
Well done!

100
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:26,170
The mate there holds ye to it stiffly.

101
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:34,542
He's no more afraid than the Isleford at Cadiget, put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes.

102
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:35,984
Forth things.

103
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:40,090
Nantucket sailor, he has his orders, mind ye that?

104
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,485
I heard old Ahab tellin' he must always kill a squall.

105
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:47,784
Something is they burst a water spout with a pistol fire, you're shipped right into it.

106
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:49,793
English Sailor

107
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,302
Blood, but that old man's a grand old cove.

108
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:56,184
We are the lads to hunt him up his whale.

109
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:59,427
Ah, aye, aye, old mank, sailor.

110
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:01,429
How the three pines shake.

111
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:09,336
Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there's none but the crew's cursed clay.

112
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,818
Steady, helmsman, steady.

113
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:18,784
This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore and keeled hulls split at sea.

114
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:20,427
Our captain has his birthmark.

115
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:21,630
Look yonder, boys.

116
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,058
There's another in the sky, lurid-like, you see, all else pitch-black.

117
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,703
Da goo, what of that?

118
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:31,028
Who's afraid of blacks afraid of me?

119
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:32,691
I'm queried out of it.

120
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,396
Spanish sailor, aside.

121
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:36,358
He wants to bully.

122
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,945
Ah, the old grudge makes me touchy, advancing.

123
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:45,155
I, Harponier, thy race is the undeniable dark side Of mankind devilish dark at that.

124
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,818
No offence.

125
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:48,401
Dagoo grimly, none.

126
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:49,183
St.

127
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:49,984
Jago's sailor.

128
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:52,309
That Spaniard's mad or drunk.

129
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:58,140
But that can't be, or else, in his one case, Our old mogul's fire-waters are somewhat long in working.

130
00:07:58,982 --> 00:08:01,326
Fiveth none tucket, sailor.

131
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:03,066
What's that I saw lightning?

132
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:12,288
Yes, Spanish sailor, Nahu showing his teeth, Dagu's bringing, Swallow thy mannequin, white skin, white liver.

133
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:13,711
Spanish sailor meeting.

134
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:18,943
Him, knife thee heartily, Big frame, small spirit, all.

135
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:26,048
A row, a row, row, A row which lith a width, A row, a low, and a row, Aloft gods and men both brawlers.

136
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,291
Humph!

137
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:31,180
Belfast sailor, A row, a row, a row, The Virgin be blessed, a row.

138
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,008
Plunging with ye English sailor, Fair play!

139
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:36,509
Snatch the Spaniard's knife.

140
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,632
A ring, a ring, old mang-sailor.

141
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,253
Ready formed.

142
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:42,715
There, the ring to risen.

143
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:44,476
In that ring, cane-struck able.

144
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,258
Sweet work, right work.

145
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:47,099
No?

146
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,200
Why then?

147
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,641
God, mird'st thou the ring?

148
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:51,602
Meet's voice from the quarter-deck.

149
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:56,607
Hands by the halyards and top-gallon sails, Stand by to reef-top sails.

150
00:08:57,127 --> 00:09:01,271
O, the squall, the squall, Jump, my jollies, they scatter.

151
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,713
Pip shrinking under the windlass, jollies,

152
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:05,184
Lord, help such jolly!

153
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:06,192
Krish!

154
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:06,534
Krash!

155
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:07,743
There goes the gypstay!

156
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:08,065
Blang!

157
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:08,489
Wanging!

158
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:09,113
God!

159
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:12,848
Duck low, Pip, here comes the Royal Yard.

160
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:16,492
It's worse than being in the World Woods the last day of the year.

161
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:19,335
Who'd go climbing after chestnuts now?

162
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:22,359
But there they go, all cursing.

163
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:24,221
And here I don't.

164
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,805
Find prospects to um— They're on the road to heaven.

165
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:30,588
Hold on hard, Jiminy, what a squall.

166
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:35,193
But those chaps there are worse, yet they are your white squalls, they.

167
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:39,538
White squalls, white whale, sure, sure.

168
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:45,594
Here have I heard all their chat just now, And the white whale sure, sure but spoken of once.

169
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:54,817
And only this evening it makes me jingle all over, Like my tambourine that anaconda of an old man Swore him in to hunt him.

170
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:07,129
O, thou big white god aloft there, Somewhere in yon darkness, Have mercy on this small black boy down here, Preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear.
