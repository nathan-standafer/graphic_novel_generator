Chapter 30 - The Pipe. When Stub had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks, and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe.

2
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:20,344
Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather-side of the deck, he sat and smote.

3
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:28,857
In old Norse times the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhal.

4
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:35,705
How could one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized?

5
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:41,832
For a khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathans was Ahab.

6
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:50,322
Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face.

7
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:51,062
How now!

8
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:54,226
he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube.

9
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,569
This smoking no longer soothes.

10
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:01,056
O my pipe, hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone!

11
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:05,181
Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring.

12
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:18,840
Ay, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while, to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,824
What business have I with this pipe?

14
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:30,528
This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-gray locks like mine.

15
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:32,392
I'll smoke no more.

16
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:35,760
He tossed the still-lighted pipe into the sea.

17
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:42,095
The fire hissed in the waves, the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made.

18
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,566
With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.
