CHAPTER XXX THE PIPE When Staub had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks, and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe.

2
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:23,805
lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp, and planting a stool on the weather-side of the deck, he sat and smoked.

3
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:33,649
In old Norse times the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhal.

4
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:41,081
How could one look at Ahab, then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him of the royalties symbolized?

5
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:48,292
For a con of the plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of leviathans, was Ahab.

6
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:56,886
Some moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face.

7
00:00:57,895 --> 00:00:58,596
"'How now?'

8
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:01,340
he silently cries at last, withdrawing the tube.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,803
"'This smoking no longer soothes.

10
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:05,545
Oh, my pipe!

11
00:01:06,086 --> 00:01:08,649
must it go with me, if thy charm be gone?'

12
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:26,232
Here have I been unconsciously toiling, with pleasuring eye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while, to windward and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.

13
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,415
What business have I with this pipe?

14
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:38,209
This thing that is meant for sereneness, To send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs, Not among torn iron-gray locks like mine.

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,051
I'll smoke no more."

16
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:43,236
He tossed the stow-lighted pipe into the sea.

17
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:48,904
The fire hissed in the waves the same instant The ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made.

18
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:53,991
With slouched hat Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.
