Chapter 120 - The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch

2
00:00:05,026 --> 00:00:07,468
AHAB standing by the helm.

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,850
Starbuck approaching him.

4
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:13,033
We must send down the main top sail yard, sir.

5
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:16,676
The band is working loose and the lee lift is half-stranded.

6
00:00:17,337 --> 00:00:18,238
Shall I strike it, sir?

7
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:20,260
Strike nothing, lash it.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,363
If I had sky sail poles, I'd sway them up now.

9
00:00:24,043 --> 00:00:25,925
Sir, in God's name, sir!

10
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:28,527
Well, the anchors are working, sir.

11
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:30,549
Shall I get them inboard?

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,033
Strike nothing and stir nothing, but lash everything.

13
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:39,150
The wind rises, but it has not got up to my table lands yet.

14
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:40,626
Quick, and see to it.

15
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:45,911
By masts and keels, he takes me for the hunchback skipper of some coasting smack.

16
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:48,313
Send down my main-top sail-yard.

17
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:49,714
Ho, glue-pots!

18
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:56,020
Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud.

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,441
Shall I strike that?

20
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:01,705
Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest-time.

21
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:03,747
What a hooroosh aloft there!

22
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:09,492
I would e'en take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady.

23
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:12,411
Oh, take medicine, take medicine.
