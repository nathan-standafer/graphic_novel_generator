00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:09,987
Chapter 72 - The Monkey Rope. In the tumultuous business of cutting in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew.

2
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:14,434
Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there.

3
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:20,703
There is no staying in any one place, for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere.

4
00:00:21,424 --> 00:00:24,649
It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene.

5
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,574
We must now retrace our way a little.

6
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:35,583
It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back, the blubber hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates.

7
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:41,049
But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole?

8
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:51,520
It was inserted there by my particular friend, Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooner, to descend upon the monster's back for the special purpose referred to.

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:59,493
But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooner shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded.

10
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:06,645
The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon.

11
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:18,604
So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooner flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a treadmill beneath him.

12
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:32,314
On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the highland costume, a shirt and socks, in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage, and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.

13
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:45,672
Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow o'er in his boat, the second one from forward, it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hardscrabble scramble upon the dead whale's back.

14
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:49,542
You have seen Italian organ boys holding a dancing ape by a long cord.

15
00:01:50,003 --> 00:02:02,496
Just so, from the ship's steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.

16
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:05,528
It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.

17
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:16,504
For, before we proceed further, it must be said that the monkey rope was fast at both ends, fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one.

18
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:32,247
So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded, and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake.

19
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:36,113
So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us.

20
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:44,808
Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother, nor could I anyway get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.

21
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:52,480
So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while earnestly watching his motions,

22
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:08,264
I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint-stock company of two, that my free will had received a mortal wound, and that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death.

23
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:17,899
Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence, for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice.

24
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,863
And yet still further pondering,

25
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:25,387
while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam him.

26
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:33,297
Still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes.

27
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:39,825
Only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connection with a plurality of other mortals.

28
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:42,549
If your banker breaks, you snap.

29
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,695
If your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die.

30
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:55,245
True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life.

31
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:58,950
But handle Queequeg's monkey rope heedfully as I would.

32
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:03,075
Sometimes he jerked it so that I came very near sliding overboard.

33
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,218
Nor could I possibly forget that.

34
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,923
Do what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.

35
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,214
CH 2.

36
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:20,005
The monkey rope is found in all whalers, but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together.

37
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:33,122
This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb in order to afford the imperiled harponeer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey rope holder.

38
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:42,338
I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship, where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both.

39
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,023
But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.

40
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:55,635
Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before-penned blood which began to flow from the carcass.

41
00:04:56,356 --> 00:05:00,021
The rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.

42
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:05,108
And right in among those sharks was Queequeg, who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet.

43
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:14,881
A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.

44
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:23,933
Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them.

45
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:36,200
Accordingly, besides the monkey rope with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark, he was provided with still another protection.

46
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:47,651
Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and Dagu continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale spades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach.

47
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:53,076
This procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterested and benevolent of them.

48
00:05:53,326 --> 00:06:08,101
They meant Queequeg's best happiness, I admit, but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half-hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.

49
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:20,413
But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook, poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.

50
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:27,144
Well, well, my dear comrade and twin brother, thought I, as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea.

51
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,127
What matters it, after all?

52
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:33,735
Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this wailing world?

53
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:45,574
That unsounded ocean you gasp in is life, those sharks your foes, those spades your friends, and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.

54
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:49,522
But courage, there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg.

55
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:59,057
For now, as with blue lips and bloodshot eyes, the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side.

56
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:04,887
The steward advances and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands himâ€”what?

57
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:06,609
Some hot cognac?

58
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,118
No, hands him, ye gods, hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water.

59
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:12,846
Ginger?

60
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:14,507
Do I smell ginger?"

61
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,270
Suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.

62
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:22,136
Yes, this must be ginger, peering into the as-yet untasted cup.

63
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:30,125
Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished steward, slowly saying, Ginger?

64
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,066
Ginger?

65
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:36,452
And will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Doughboy, where lies the virtue of ginger?

66
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:37,113
Ginger.

67
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:42,321
Is ginger the sort of fuel you use, doughboy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal?

68
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:43,162
Ginger.

69
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:44,705
What the devil is ginger?

70
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:45,687
Sea coal?

71
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:46,468
Firewood?

72
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,570
Lucifer matches?

73
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,451
Sea coal?

74
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:49,252
Firewood?

75
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:50,494
Lucifer matches?

76
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,275
Tinder?

77
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:52,097
Gunpowder?

78
00:07:52,397 --> 00:07:57,225
What the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here?

79
00:07:57,205 --> 00:08:04,573
There is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business," he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from forward.

80
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:06,735
"'Will you look at that canican, sir?

81
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:07,996
Smell of it, if you please?'

82
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:17,686
Then, watching the mate's countenance, he added, "'The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that collimel and hollub to Queequeg, there, this instant, off the whale.

83
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:20,048
Is the steward an apothecary, sir?

84
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:26,655
And may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?'

85
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:29,349
I trust not, said Starbuck.

86
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:31,030
It is poor stuff enough.

87
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:33,793
Aye, aye, steward, cried Stubb.

88
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:35,795
We'll teach you to drug at Harpoonier.

89
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,957
None of your apothecaries' medicine here.

90
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:39,939
You want to poison us, do ye?

91
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:45,544
You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all and pocket the proceeds, do ye?

92
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:48,107
It was not me, cried Doughboy.

93
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:56,895
It was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board and bade me never give the Harpooniers any spirits but only this ginger-jub, so she called it.

94
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:02,984
Ginger Jub, you gingerly rascal, take that and run along with you to the lockers and get something better.

95
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:05,728
I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck.

96
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:06,970
It is the captain's orders.

97
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,453
Grodd for the harpooner on a whale.

98
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:20,068
Enough, replied Starbuck, only don't hit him again, but... Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of that sort, and this fellow's a weasel.

99
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,171
What were you about saying, sir?

100
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:26,798
Only this, go down with him and get what thou wantest thyself.

101
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:32,115
When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of tea caddy in the other.

102
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:36,503
The first contained strong spirits and was handed to Queequeg.

103
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:41,412
The second was Aunt Charity's gift, and that was freely given to the waves.
