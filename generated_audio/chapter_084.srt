Chapter 84 - Pitch-Polling.

3
00:00:03,214 --> 00:00:13,763
To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed, and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat, they grease the bottom.

4
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:29,717
Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage, considering that oil and water are hostile, that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely.

5
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:49,383
Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning, not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation, crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel.

6
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:57,173
He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment, nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.

7
00:00:57,153 --> 00:01:07,795
Towards noon whales were raised, but so soon as the ship sailed down to them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy, a disordered flight, as of Cleopatra's barges from Actium.

8
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:12,445
Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubbs was foremost.

9
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:16,731
By great exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron.

10
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:22,983
But the stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness.

11
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:28,755
Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it.

12
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:34,045
It became imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him.

13
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:38,631
But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and furious.

14
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:40,013
What then remained?

15
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:52,570
Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the slights of hand and countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced, none exceed that fine maneuver with the lance called pitch-pulling.

16
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:57,157
Small-sword or broad-sword, in all its exercises, boasts nothing like it.

17
00:01:57,657 --> 00:02:01,062
It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale.

18
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:10,307
Its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat under extreme headway.

19
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:16,705
Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some 10 or 12 feet in length.

20
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,439
The staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a lighter material, pine.

21
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:30,492
It is furnished with a small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting.

22
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:39,486
But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the harpoon may be pitch-pulled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom done.

23
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:49,759
And when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks.

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,227
As a general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any pitch-polling comes into play.

25
00:02:56,948 --> 00:03:06,700
Look now at Stubb, a man who, from his humorous, deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in pitch-polling.

26
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:08,342
Look at him.

27
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:16,181
He stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat, wrapped in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.

28
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:31,444
Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed.

29
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:36,293
Then holding the lance full before his waistband's middle, he levels it at the whale.

30
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:47,593
When, covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air.

31
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:51,702
He minds you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin.

32
00:03:51,742 --> 00:04:02,104
Next moment, with a rapid nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch, the bright steel spans the foaming distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale.

33
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:06,173
Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.

34
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:09,839
That drove the spigot out of him, cried Stubb.

35
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,385
Tis July's immortal fourth, all fountains must run wine today.

36
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:21,194
Would now, it were old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela.

37
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:26,881
Then, Tashtego lad, I'd have you hold a canick into the jet, and we'd drink round it.

38
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:35,653
Yea, verily, hearts alive, we'd brew choice punch in the spread of his spout hole there, and from that live punch bowl quaff the living stuff.

39
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:45,356
Again and again, to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skillful leash.

40
00:04:46,158 --> 00:04:55,498
The agonized whale goes into his flurry, the toe-line is slackened, and the pitch-poller dropping a stern folds his hands and mutely watches the monster die.
