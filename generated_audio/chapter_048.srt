00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:14,178
Chapter 48 - The First Lowering. The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of the deck and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:23,035
This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter.

3
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:30,892
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swort, with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips.

4
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:38,712
A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funerally invested him, with wide black trousers of the same dark stuff.

5
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:47,075
But strangely crowning this eboness was a glistening white-plated turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head.

6
00:00:47,936 --> 00:01:00,852
Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manilas, a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty.

7
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:10,973
and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting room they supposed to be elsewhere.

8
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:18,790
While yet the wandering ship's company were gazing upon these strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,

9
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,011
Already there, Fedala?"

10
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:22,574
Ready, was the half-hissed reply.

11
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:25,958
Lower away then, Dahir, shouting across the deck.

12
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,841
Lower away there, I say.

13
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:41,757
Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail, the sheaves whirled round in the blocks, with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea, while, with a dexterous off-handed daring,

14
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:48,725
unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into the tossed boats below.

15
00:01:48,745 --> 00:02:08,588
Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee when a fourth keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stub, and Flask to spread themselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of water.

16
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:15,497
But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fadala and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.

17
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:20,383
Captain Ahab, said Starbuck, spread yourselves, cried Ahab.

18
00:02:20,763 --> 00:02:22,185
Give way, all four boats.

19
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:24,748
Thou flask, pull out more to leeward.

20
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:31,056
Aye, aye, sir, cheerily cried Little King, post sweeping round his great steering oar.

21
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,900
Lay back, addressing his crew.

22
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:36,768
There, there, there, there, then!

23
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:39,199
There she blows right ahead, boys.

24
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:40,163
Lay back.

25
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:43,317
Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archie.

26
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,559
Oh, I don't mind him, sir," said Arky.

27
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,262
I knew it all before now.

28
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:48,745
Didn't I hear him in the hold?

29
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:51,210
And didn't I tell Cabico here of it?

30
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,073
What say ye, Cabico?

31
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,758
They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.

32
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:57,682
Pull, pull, my fine hearts alive!

33
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:58,684
Pull, my children!

34
00:02:58,784 --> 00:02:59,806
Pull, my little ones!

35
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,809
Drawlingly and soothingly sighed.

36
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:06,418
Stubbed to his crew, some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness.

37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,683
Why don't you break your backbones, my boys?

38
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:11,126
Why don't you break your backbones, my boys?

39
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,588
What is it you stare at?

40
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:14,931
Those chaps in yonder boat?

41
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:15,872
Tut!

42
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:21,058
They are only five more hands come to help us, never mind from where.

43
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:22,840
The more the merrier.

44
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:26,645
Pull then, do pull, never mind the brimstone.

45
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:29,689
Devils are good fellows enough.

46
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:31,900
So, so, there you are now.

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,423
That's the stroke for a thousand pounds.

48
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:36,627
That's the stroke to sweep the stakes.

49
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:40,352
Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes.

50
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:42,956
Three cheers, men, all hearts alive.

51
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:45,500
Easy, easy, don't be in a hurry.

52
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,642
Don't be in a hurry.

53
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,185
Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals?

54
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:50,768
Bite something, you dogs.

55
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:52,631
So, so, so, then.

56
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:54,934
Softly, softly.

57
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:55,535
That's it.

58
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:56,336
That's it.

59
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:57,639
Long and strong.

60
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:58,861
Give way there.

61
00:03:59,121 --> 00:03:59,662
Give way.

62
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:01,285
The devil fetch ye.

63
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:03,248
Ye ragamuffin-wrapped scallions.

64
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:04,570
Ye are all asleep.

65
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:07,195
Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.

66
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:08,537
Pull, will ye?

67
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:09,559
Pull, can't ye?

68
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:10,620
Pull, won't ye?

69
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,946
Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger cakes don't ye pull?

70
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,449
Pull and break something.

71
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:16,210
Pull.

72
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:17,652
And start your eyes out.

73
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:18,694
Here.

74
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,597
whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle.

75
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:25,224
Every mother's son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth.

76
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:26,346
That's it!

77
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:27,327
That's it!

78
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:28,910
Now ye do something!

79
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,293
That looks like it, my steel bits!

80
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:32,675
Start her!

81
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:34,698
Start her, my silver spoons!

82
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,862
Start her, marling spikes!

83
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:47,618
Stubbs' exhortium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing.

84
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:55,279
But you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation.

85
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:59,439
Not at all, and therein consisted his chief peculiarity.

86
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:16,716
He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing.

87
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:22,161
Besides, he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself.

88
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:35,547
so loungingly managed his steering oar and so broadly gaped, open-mouthed at times, that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew.

89
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:47,980
Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.

90
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:58,522
In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubb's bow, and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.

91
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:00,125
Mr. Starbuck!

92
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:01,367
Larboard boat there!

93
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:01,968
Ahoy!

94
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,433
A word with you, sir, if you please.

95
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,241
"'Halloa!'

96
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:16,827
returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke, still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew, his face set like a flint from stubs, his face set like a flint from stubs.

97
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:19,913
"'What think ye of those yellow boys, sir?'

98
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:23,822
smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed.

99
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:28,567
Strong, strong, boys," in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again.

100
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:30,829
A sad business, Mr. Stubb.

101
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,092
Seethe her, seethe her, my lads.

102
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:35,534
But never mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best.

103
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:38,317
Let all your crew pull strong, come what will.

104
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:40,339
Spring, my men, spring.

105
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:43,062
There's hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb.

106
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:45,765
There's hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb.

107
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:48,207
And that's what ye came for.

108
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:49,410
Pull, my boys.

109
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,117
Sperm, sperm's the play.

110
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:55,625
This at least is duty, duty and profit, hand in hand.

111
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:00,838
Aye, aye, I thought as much, soliloquized Stubb, when the boats diverged.

112
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,086
As soon as I clapped eye on him, I thought so.

113
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:08,996
Aye, and that's what he went into the afterhold for, so often, as Doughboy long suspected.

114
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:10,600
They were hidden down there.

115
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:12,644
The white whale's at the bottom of it.

116
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:14,448
Well, well, so be it.

117
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:15,390
Can't be helped.

118
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,252
All right.

119
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:17,595
Scant be helped.

120
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:18,376
All right.

121
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:19,759
Give way, men.

122
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,623
It ain't the white whale today.

123
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:22,986
Give way.

124
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:36,137
Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably awakened, a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship's company.

125
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:47,573
But Arky's fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some small measure prepared them for the event.

126
00:07:47,553 --> 00:08:06,979
It took off the extreme edge of their wonder, and so what with all this and Stubbs' confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings, though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to Dark Ahab's precise agency in the matter from the beginning.

127
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:18,606
For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.

128
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:30,041
Meantime, a hob, out of hearing of his officers having sighted the furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats, a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him.

129
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:34,528
Those tiger-yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone.

130
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:45,606
Like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer.

131
00:08:45,586 --> 00:09:07,459
As for Fidala, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwall, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon, while at the other end of the boat, Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer's, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip.

132
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:13,548
Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat-lowerings ere the white whale had torn him.

133
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:22,001
All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.

134
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,447
Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea.

135
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:30,274
Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way.

136
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:40,638
The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.

137
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:44,964
Every man look out along his oars, cried Starbuck.

138
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,268
Thou, Queequeg, stand up!

139
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:59,907
Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been described.

140
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:16,883
Likewise, upon the extreme stern of the boat, where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.

141
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:31,077
Not very far distant, Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still, its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform.

142
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,480
It is used for catching turns with the whale-line.

143
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:46,212
Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man's hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the masthead of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks.

144
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:58,048
But Little King Post was small and short, and at the same time Little King Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead standpoint of his did by no means satisfy King Post.

145
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,812
I can't see three seas off.

146
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:03,175
Tip us up an oar there, and let me on to that.

147
00:11:04,257 --> 00:11:14,190
Upon this, Dagu, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself, volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal.

148
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,875
good a masthead as any, sir.

149
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,040
Will you mount?

150
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:23,202
That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow, only I wish you fifty feet taller."

151
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:44,041
whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders.

152
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:52,851
And here was Flask now standing, Dagu with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by.

153
00:11:52,831 --> 00:12:06,510
At any time it is a strange sight to the Tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas.

154
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:13,219
Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances.

155
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:28,851
But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Dagu was yet more curious, for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought-of barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form.

156
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:33,520
On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snowflake,

157
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,384
The bearer looked nobler than the rider.

158
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:47,290
Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience, but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly chest.

159
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:55,391
So have I seen passion and vanity stamping the living, magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.

160
00:12:56,112 --> 00:13:00,556
Meanwhile Stub, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes.

161
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:14,391
The whales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright, and if that were the case, Stub, as is wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe.

162
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:18,575
He withdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it a slant like a feather.

163
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:40,195
He loaded it and rammed home the loading with his thumb end, but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooner, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick frenzy of hurry, Down, down all, and give way!

164
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:41,897
There they are!

165
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:58,570
To a landsman, no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been visible at that moment, nothing but a troubled bit of greenish-white water and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white-rolling billows.

166
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:04,519
The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as it were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron.

167
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:12,350
Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of water also, the whales were swimming.

168
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:20,883
Seen in advance of all the other indications, the pups of vapor they spouted seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.

169
00:14:21,584 --> 00:14:26,852
All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air.

170
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,850
but it bade fair to outstrip them.

171
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:35,060
It flew on and on as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.

172
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:42,833
Pull, pull, my good boys, said Starbuck in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men.

173
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:50,931
while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses.

174
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:55,535
He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him.

175
00:14:56,316 --> 00:15:04,664
Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.

176
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:08,348
How different the loud little king post!

177
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,083
Sing out and say something, my hearties.

178
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,586
Roar and pull, my thunderbolts.

179
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:16,930
Beach me, beach me on their black backs, boys.

180
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:24,298
Only do that for me, and I'll sign over to you my Martha's Vineyard Plantation, boys, including wife and children, boys.

181
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,542
Lay me on, lay me on, O Lord, Lord.

182
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:30,145
But I shall go stark, staring mad.

183
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:32,648
See, see that white water.

184
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:45,185
And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and down on it, then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea, and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.

185
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:54,538
Look at that chap now, philosophically drawled stub, who with his unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short distance, followed after.

186
00:15:54,598 --> 00:15:56,941
He's got fits that flask has.

187
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:59,344
Fits that flask has.

188
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:00,073
Fits!

189
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:03,140
Yes, give him fits, that's the very word.

190
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:04,924
Pitch fits into him.

191
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:07,309
Merrily, merrily, heart's alive.

192
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:10,537
Pudding for supper, you know, marries the word.

193
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:13,844
Pull babes, pull sucklings, pull all.

194
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,232
But what the devil are you hurrying about?

195
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:19,811
Softly, softly and steadily, my men.

196
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:22,756
Only pull and keep pulling, nothing more.

197
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:27,122
Crack all your backbones and bite your knives in two, that's all.

198
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:28,444
Take it easy.

199
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:32,250
Why don't you take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and lungs?

200
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:37,278
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of his.

201
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,782
These were words best omitted here.

202
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:44,029
For you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land.

203
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:54,683
Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words when, with tornado brow and eyes of red murder and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.

204
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:57,387
Meanwhile, all the boats tore on.

205
00:16:57,447 --> 00:17:08,041
The repeated specific allusions of Flask to that whale, as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its tail.

206
00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:12,126
These allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelike,

207
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:16,493
that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder.

208
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:30,095
But this was against all rule, for the oarsmen must put out their eyes and ram a skewer through their necks, usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.

209
00:17:30,956 --> 00:17:33,861
It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe.

210
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:44,251
The vast swells of the omnipotent sea, the surging, hollow roar they made as they rolled along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling green.

211
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:54,101
The brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tit for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two.

212
00:17:54,141 --> 00:18:02,869
The sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows, the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill.

213
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:06,477
The headlong sled-like slide down its other side.

214
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:13,308
All these with the cries of the headsmen and harpooners and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen.

215
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:19,618
Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle.

216
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:24,807
Not the dead man's ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world.

217
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:35,685
Neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm whale.

218
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:44,879
The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud shadows flung upon the sea.

219
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,926
The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left.

220
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:52,650
The whales seemed separating their wakes.

221
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:57,681
The boats were pulled more apart, Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward.

222
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:11,063
Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along, the boat going with such madness through the water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row locks.

223
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:18,756
Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist, neither ship nor boat to be seen.

224
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:23,605
Give way, men," whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail.

225
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:27,151
There is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.

226
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:30,317
There's white water again, close to, spring.

227
00:19:30,357 --> 00:19:42,820
Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast, but hardly were they overheard when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said, Stand up!

228
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:50,869
and Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet, though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life-and-death peril so close to them ahead.

229
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:57,276
Yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had come.

230
00:19:57,336 --> 00:20:03,163
They heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.

231
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:12,013
Meanwhile, the boat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.

232
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:13,155
That's his hump.

233
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:17,761
There, there, there, give it to him, whispered Starbuck.

234
00:20:18,822 --> 00:20:21,125
A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat.

235
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:23,608
It was the darted iron of Kwee Kweg.

236
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:28,114
Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from a stern.

237
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:31,298
While forward, the boat seemed striking on a ledge.

238
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:33,861
The sail collapsed and exploded.

239
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:36,965
A gush of scalding vapor shot up nearby.

240
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:40,870
Something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us.

241
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:46,451
The whole crew were half-suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall.

242
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:53,623
Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended together, and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.

243
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:57,930
Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.

244
00:20:58,113 --> 00:21:03,804
Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale, tumbled back to our places.

245
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:16,088
There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward-gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean.

246
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,731
The wind increased to a howl.

247
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:20,155
The waves dashed their bucklers together.

248
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:30,533
The whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie in which, unconsumed, we were burning, immortal in these jaws of death.

249
00:21:31,154 --> 00:21:39,045
In vain we hailed the other boats, as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm.

250
00:21:39,826 --> 00:21:44,613
Meanwhile, the driving scud, rack, and mist grew darker with the shadows of night.

251
00:21:45,113 --> 00:21:46,716
No sign of the ship could be seen.

252
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:51,222
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bail out the boat.

253
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,687
The ores were useless as propellers, performing now the office of life preservers.

254
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:10,292
So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures, Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern, then stretching it on a wave pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard bearer of this forlorn hope.

255
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:16,703
There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness.

256
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:24,322
There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.

257
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:32,903
Wet, drenched through and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on.

258
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:35,358
The mist still spread over the sea.

259
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:38,523
The empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.

260
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:43,331
Suddenly, Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.

261
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:48,979
We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm.

262
00:22:49,941 --> 00:22:51,503
The sound came nearer and nearer.

263
00:22:51,844 --> 00:22:55,870
The thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form.

264
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:04,442
Afrighted, we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length.

265
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:18,307
Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip at the base of a cataract, and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern.

266
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:25,718
Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on board.

267
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:32,387
Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.

268
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:39,998
The ship had given us up but was still cruising, if happily it might light upon some token of our perishing, an oar or a lance pole.
