00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:05,579
Chapter 47 THE MATMAKER It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon.

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:11,648
The seamen were lazily lounging about the decks or vacantly gazing over into the lead-colored waters.

3
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:19,018
Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an additional lashing to our boat.

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:32,233
So still and subdued, and yet somehow preluding, was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self.

5
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:37,401
I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat.

6
00:00:37,522 --> 00:00:42,930
As I kept passing and repassing the filling or roof of Marlene between the long yarns of the warp,

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:01:01,695
Using my own hand for the shuttle, and this quick quake standing sideways, Averin anon slid his heavy-oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn car I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea,

8
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:14,858
only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the loom of time and I might- There lay the fixed threads of the warp, subject to but one single, ever-returning, unchanging vibration.

9
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:21,434
and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own.

10
00:01:22,134 --> 00:01:31,965
This warp seemed necessity, and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads.

11
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:40,474
Meantime, Kwee Kweg's impulsive indifference soared, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly, as the case might be.

12
00:01:40,454 --> 00:01:52,634
And by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric, beasts savage a sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof.

13
00:01:53,275 --> 00:02:01,348
And thee, Z.C., indifferent sword, must be chance, a chance, free will, and necessity now wise, incompatible all interweavingly working together."

14
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:23,455
The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate corsets every alternating vibrationâ€”indeed, only tending to that vray will, still free to ply her shuttle between given threads, enchants, though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will,

15
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:31,307
though thus prescribed to by both, chants by turns rules either, and has the last featuring blow at events.

16
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:47,552
Thus we were weaving and weaving away, when I started at a sound so strange, long-drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds,

17
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,636
whence that voice dropped like a wing.

18
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:54,123
High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad gay header Tashtego.

19
00:02:54,844 --> 00:03:03,499
His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hands stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries.

20
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:13,014
To be sure, the same sound was that very moment, perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen's lookouts perched as high in the air.

21
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:30,583
But from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego, the Indians, as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon,

22
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:38,596
you would have thought him some prophet or seer, beholding the shadows of fate, and by those wild cries announcing their coming.

23
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,823
There she blows, there, there, there.

24
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:44,326
She blows, she blows.

25
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:45,568
Where are we?

26
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:52,610
on the lee-beam, about two miles off, a school of them instantly all was commotion.

27
00:03:53,271 --> 00:04:03,169
The sperm-whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity, and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus.

28
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,751
"'There go flukes!'

29
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:08,455
was now the cry from Tashdegel, and the whales disappeared.

30
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:10,057
"'Quick, steward!'

31
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:11,119
cried Ahab.

32
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:24,415
"'Tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine, tine,

33
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:52,967
Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to Leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows, for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm-whale, when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter, this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action.

34
00:04:52,947 --> 00:05:01,999
For there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtagil had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew a toll of our vicinity.

35
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:12,773
One of the men selected for ship-keepers, that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head.

36
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:20,423
The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down, the line-tubs were fixed in their places, the cranes were thrust out.

37
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:28,051
The main yard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three sampire baskets over high cliffs.

38
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:37,981
Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale.

39
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:44,588
So looked the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw themselves on board an enemy ship.

40
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:59,809
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale, with a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.
