00:00:00,048 --> 00:00:08,317
Chapter 39 - First Night. Watch Foretop A stub saloos, and mending a brace.

2
00:00:08,817 --> 00:00:08,978
Ha!

3
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:09,258
Ha!

4
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:09,618
Ha!

5
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:10,099
Ha!

6
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:10,379
Ha!

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:10,780
Him!

8
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,701
Clear my throat!

9
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,804
I've been thinking over it ever since, and that Ha!

10
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:16,306
Ha's the final consequence.

11
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:17,227
Why so?

12
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:24,014
Because a laugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all that's queer, and come what will, one comfort's always left.

13
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:27,878
That unfailing comfort is, it's all predestinated.

14
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:34,788
I heard not all his talk with Starbuck, but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt.

15
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,832
Be sure the old mogul has fixed him too.

16
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:42,438
I twigged it, knew it, had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it.

17
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,622
For when I clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it.

18
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:49,147
Well, Stubb, wise Stubb, that's my title.

19
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:51,230
Well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb?

20
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,034
Here's a carcass, here's a carcass.

21
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:54,875
Here's a carcass.

22
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:59,603
I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I'll go to it laughing.

23
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:03,208
Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles.

24
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:04,470
I feel funny.

25
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:08,035
Fa, la, lira, skira.

26
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:10,239
What's my juicy little pear at home doing now?

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,242
Crying its eyes out?

28
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:16,148
Giving a party to the last arrived harpooners, I dare say.

29
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:18,992
Gay as a frigate's pennant, and so am I.

30
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:21,895
Fa, la, lira, scura.

31
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:35,106
Oh, we'll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love as gay and fleeting, As bubbles that swim on the beaker's brim, And break on the lips while meeting, A brave stave that, who calls?

32
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:37,752
Mr. Starbuck, aye, aye, sir.

33
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:41,982
Aside, he's my superior, He has his too, if I'm not mistaken.

34
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:45,891
Aye, aye, sir, just through with this job, Coming.
