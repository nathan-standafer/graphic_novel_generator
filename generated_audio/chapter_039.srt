CHAPTER XXXVIII.

2
00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:02,534
Dusk.

3
00:00:02,554 --> 00:00:03,815
By the main-mass Starbuck.

4
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:05,157
Leaning against it.

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,203
My soul is more than matched, she is overmanned, and by a madman.

6
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:14,007
Insufferable sting that sanity should ground arms on such a feel.

7
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:17,872
But he drilled deep down and blasted all my reason out of me.

8
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:22,377
I think I see his impious end, but feel that I must help him to it.

9
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:29,756
Will I, nill I, The ineffable thing has tied me to him, Toes me with a cable I have no knife to cut.

10
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:31,299
Horrible old man!

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,402
Who's over him?

12
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:38,357
he cries I. He would be a Democrat to all above luck, How he lords it over all below.

13
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:51,452
O, I plainly see my miserable office To obey, rebelling, worse yet, to hate With touch of pity, for in his eyes I read Some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it.

14
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:54,861
Yet is there hope, time and tide flow wide.

15
00:00:54,841 --> 00:01:01,834
The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, As the small goldfish has its glassy globe.

16
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:05,762
His heaven-insulting purpose God may wedge aside.

17
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:13,997
I would up heart were it not like lead, But my whole clocks run down my heart, The all-controlling weight I have no key to lift again.

18
00:01:13,977 --> 00:01:16,580
A. Burst of revelry.

19
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:18,062
From the forecastle.

20
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,904
A. O. God!

21
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:24,250
To sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them.

22
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:29,136
Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea, the white whale is there denigorgon.

23
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:30,538
Hark!

24
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:32,901
the infernal orgies that revelry is forward.

25
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:35,604
Mark the unfaltering silence aft.

26
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:37,707
Bethinks it pictures life.

27
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:51,426
Foremost through the sparkling sea Shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow, But only to drag dark Ahab after it, Where he broods within his sternward cabin, Builded over the dead water of the wake.

28
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,906
And further on hunted by its wolfish gurglings.

29
00:01:55,947 --> 00:01:57,950
The long howl thrills me through.

30
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,794
Peace, ye revelers, and set the watch.

31
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:10,467
O life, tis in an hour like this, With soul beat down and held to knowledge, As wild, untutored things are forced to feed O life.

32
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:14,612
Tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee.

33
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:24,298
But tis not me that horrors out of me, And with the soft feeling of the human in me, Yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim phantom futures.

34
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:28,669
Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences.
