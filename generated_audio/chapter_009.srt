1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:09,520
Chapter 9 The Sermon Father Mapple rose, and, in a mild voice of unassuming authority, ordered the scattered people to condense.

2
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:16,147
Starboard gangway there, side-away to larboard, larboard gangway to starboard, midships, midships.

3
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:26,477
There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quiet again.

4
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:28,239
and every eye on the preacher.

5
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:44,378
He paused a little, then kneeling in the pulpit's boughs, folded his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea.

6
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:52,548
This ended in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a foggin.

7
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:56,312
Such tones he commenced reading the following hymn,

8
00:00:56,292 --> 00:01:02,649
But changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas, burst forth with appealing exultation and joy.

9
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:11,753
The ribs and terrors in the whale Arched over me a dismal gloom, While all God's sunlit waves rolled by,

10
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,958
And lift me deepening down to doom.

11
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:21,336
I saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there, Which none but they that feel can tell.

12
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:24,062
O, I was plunging to despair!

13
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:29,455
In black distress I called my God, When I could scarce believe Him mine,

14
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:31,497
He bowed his ear to my complaints.

15
00:01:32,098 --> 00:01:34,120
No more the whale did me confine.

16
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:43,991
With speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin born, awful yet bright, As lightning shone the face of my Deliverer God.

17
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:52,360
My song for ever shall record, That terrible, that joyful hour, I give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.

18
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:59,408
Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, Which swelled high above the howling of the storm.

19
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:00,929
A brief pause ensued.

20
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:15,237
The preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said, "'Beloved shipmates,' clinched the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah.

21
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:19,183
and God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.

22
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:27,695
Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters, four yarns, is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.

23
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:32,161
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sea-line sound?

24
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:36,027
What a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet!

25
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:39,792
What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish's belly!

26
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:42,857
How billow-like and boisterously grand!

27
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:45,360
We feel the flood surging over us.

28
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:49,086
We sound with hymn to the kelpy bottom of the waters.

29
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:52,631
Seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us.

30
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:56,096
But what is this lesson that the Book of Jonah teaches?

31
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:57,778
Shipmates,

32
00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:05,629
It is a two-stranded lesson, a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.

33
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:20,391
As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally, the deliverance and joy of Jonah.

34
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:28,620
As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his willful disobedience of the command of God, never mind.

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,905
Now what that command was, or how conveyed, which he found a hard command.

36
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:39,130
But all the things that God would have us do, are hard for us to do, remember.

37
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:44,556
That, and hence, he oftener commands us, than endeavours to persuade.

38
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:53,747
And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves, and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.

39
00:03:54,488 --> 00:04:01,317
With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God, by seeking to flee from Him.

40
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:07,945
He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign,

41
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:10,311
but only the captains of this earth.

42
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:15,404
He skulks about the wharves of Japa and seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish.

43
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:20,196
There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here.

44
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:25,682
By all accounts, Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.

45
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:30,553
That's the opinion of learned men, and whereas Cadiz, shipmates.

46
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:38,792
Cadiz is in Spain as far by water from Jopa as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days.

47
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:57,378
when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea, because Yoppa, the modern Jaffa shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian, and Tarshish, or Cadiz, more than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar.

48
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:02,385
See ye not, then, shipmates, that Jonas ought to flee world-wide from God?

49
00:05:02,926 --> 00:05:03,907
Miserable man!

50
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:07,412
O most contemptible and worthy of all scorn!

51
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:16,686
with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his god, prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar, hastening to cross the seas.

52
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:29,485
So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck.

53
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:31,507
How plainly he's a fugitive!

54
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:35,791
No baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag.

55
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,094
No friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieu.

56
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:57,210
At last, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarsha's ship receiving the last items of her cargo, and, as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger's evil eye.

57
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:04,383
Jonah sees this, but in vain he tries To look all ease and confidence, in vain Essays his wretched smile.

58
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:09,894
Strong intuitions of the man Assure the mariners he can be no innocent.

59
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:17,207
In their gamesome but still serious way One whispers to the other, Jack, he's robbed a widow!

60
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:18,391
Joe.

61
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:21,114
Dear Markham, he's a bigamist o'er."

62
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:29,344
Harry lad, I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in Old Gomorrah, or Belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.

63
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:44,981
Another runs to read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parasite, and containing a description of his person.

64
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:45,962
He reads,

65
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:53,655
and looks from Jonah to the bill, while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him.

66
00:06:54,537 --> 00:07:01,770
Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.

67
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:07,680
He will not confess himself suspected, but that itself is strong suspicion.

68
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:17,314
So he makes the best of it, and, when the sailors find him, not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.

69
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,156
"'Who's there?'

70
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:24,043
cries the captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his papers for the customs.

71
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:26,627
"'Who's there?'

72
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:30,192
Oh, how that harmless question mangles Jonah!"

73
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:33,737
For the instant he almost turns to flee again, but he rallies.

74
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:36,420
I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish.

75
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:38,222
How soon, say Lisa?"

76
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:49,978
Thus far the busy captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him, but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance.

77
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,605
We sail with the next coming tide, at last he slowly answered,

78
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:57,588
still intently eyeing him.

79
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,750
No sooner, sir.

80
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,775
Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.

81
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:10,026
Ah, Jonah, that's another stab, but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent.

82
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:11,928
I'll sail with ye, he says.

83
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,472
The passage-money, how much is that?

84
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,575
I'll pay now.

85
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:26,302
For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail.

86
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:30,773
In taking with the context, this is full of meaning.

87
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:40,309
Now Jonah's captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penalists.

88
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:51,327
In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport whereas virtue, if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers.

89
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:55,092
So Jonah's captain prepares to test the length of Jonah's purse.

90
00:08:55,793 --> 00:09:01,239
Ere he judge him openly, he charges him thrice, the usual sum, and it's assented to.

91
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:09,369
Then the captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive, but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold.

92
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:15,978
Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the captain.

93
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:19,542
He wrings every coin to find a counterfeit.

94
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:24,572
"'Not a forger, anyway,' he mutters, and Jonah is put down for his passage.

95
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:28,058
"'Point out my stateroom, sir,' says Jonah now.

96
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:32,126
"'I'm travel-weary, if I need sleep.'

97
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:34,009
"'Thou look'st like it,' says the captain.

98
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,352
"'There's thy room.'

99
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:41,243
Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key.

100
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:52,283
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked within.

101
00:09:52,323 --> 00:10:01,760
All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead.

102
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,986
The air is close, and Jonah gasps

103
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:22,333
Then, in that contracted hole, sunk too beneath the ship's waterline, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels worn, screwed at its axes against the side,

104
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:48,186
A swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah's room, and a ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last gales received, the lamp, flame, and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room, though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false line levels among which it hung.

105
00:10:48,166 --> 00:11:00,709
The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah as, lying in his berth, his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.

106
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:05,277
But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appalls him.

107
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:09,364
The floor, the ceiling, and the side are all awry.

108
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:17,192
Oh, so my conscience hangs in me, he groans, straight upwards, So it burns of my soul, or all in crookedness."

109
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:37,393
Like one who after a night of drunken revelry Hies to his bed, still reeling, but with conscience Yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman racehorse, But so much the more strike he still tags into him, As one who in that miserable plight Still turns and turns in giddy anguish, Praying God for annihilation until the fit be past.

110
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:48,706
And dods band and wren, and at amid the whirl Of woe feels a deep stupor steals over him, As over the man who bleeds to death For conscience is the wound, and there's not To staunch to staunch so after.

111
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:59,719
And now the time of tide has come, The ship casts off her cables, and from the deserted wharf The uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, Glides to sea.

112
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:03,382
That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers.

113
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:05,804
The contraband was Jonah.

114
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:09,148
But the sea rebels, he will not bear the wicked burden.

115
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:11,510
A dreadful storm comes on.

116
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,331
The ship is like to break.

117
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:29,706
But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her, when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard, when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah's head,

118
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:34,413
In all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.

119
00:12:34,694 --> 00:12:39,722
He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers.

120
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:48,876
And little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him.

121
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:58,471
Ay, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship of birth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep.

122
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:05,802
But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead air, What meanest thou, sleeper, arise?

123
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:16,298
Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and, stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea.

124
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:22,507
But at that moment he is sprung upon By a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks.

125
00:13:22,707 --> 00:13:33,223
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, And, finding no speedy vent, runs roaring Fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh To drowning while yet afloat.

126
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:47,837
And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies and the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.

127
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:52,318
terrors upon terrors run, shouting through his soul.

128
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:58,070
In all his cringing attitudes the god fugitive is now too plainly known.

129
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:06,045
The sailors mark him more and more certain, grow their suspicions of him, and at last fully to test the truth

130
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:14,855
By referring the whole matter to High Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them.

131
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:20,202
The latter's jonahs that discover then how furiously they mob him with their questions.

132
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:22,324
What is thine occupation?

133
00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:23,946
Whence comest thou?

134
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:25,088
Thy country?

135
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:26,169
What people?

136
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,434
But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor jonah.

137
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:33,838
The eager mariners but ask him who he is.

138
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:42,688
and wherefrom, whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by them.

139
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:50,197
But the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.

140
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:57,084
"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries, and then, "'I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.

141
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:59,387
Fear him, O Jonah!

142
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:03,092
Ay, well mightest thou fear the Lord God then.

143
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:12,626
Straightway, he now goes on to make a full confession, whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still are pitiful.

144
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:23,502
For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts, when wretched, Jonah cries out to them to take him,

145
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:29,911
and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them.

146
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:35,018
They mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship.

147
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:46,333
But all in vain the indignant gale howls louder then, with one hand raised invoking we to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.

148
00:15:46,313 --> 00:16:01,842
And now, behold, Jonah taken up as an anchor, and dropped into the sea, when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind.

149
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:19,272
He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him, and the whale shoots to all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.

150
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:22,557
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly.

151
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:26,985
But observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson.

152
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:31,692
For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance.

153
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:35,118
He feels that his dreadful punishment is just.

154
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,905
He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this.

155
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:45,695
That spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards his holy temple.

156
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:54,188
And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance, not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment.

157
00:16:54,168 --> 00:17:01,843
and how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.

158
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:12,283
Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin, but I do place him before you as a model for repentance.

159
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:16,311
Sin not, but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah,

160
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:30,457
While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm-without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.

161
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:44,695
His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell, his tossed arm seeing the warring elements at work, and the thunders that rolled away from off his worthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye,

162
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:51,022
made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.

163
00:17:51,142 --> 00:18:04,857
There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves of the book once more, and, at last, standing motionless with closed eyes, for the moment, seemed commuting with God and himself.

164
00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:14,648
But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words.

165
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:20,741
Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you, both his hands press upon me.

166
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:32,788
I have read ye by what murky light may be mine, the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners, and therefore to you, and still more to me, for I am a greater sinner than you.

167
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:48,611
And now how gladly would I come down from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen while some one of you reads M.E., that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to M.E.

168
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,494
as a pilot of the living God.

169
00:18:50,574 --> 00:19:01,189
How, being an anointed pilot prophet, or speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh,

170
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:10,919
Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.

171
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,883
But God is everywhere, Tarshish, he never reached.

172
00:19:15,064 --> 00:19:26,856
As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of the seas,

173
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:37,952
where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and the weeds were wrapped about his head, and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.

174
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:52,152
Yet even then, beyond the reach of any plummet out of the belly of hell, when the whale grounded upon the ocean's utmost bones, even then God heard the engulfed, repenting prophet when he cried.

175
00:19:52,486 --> 00:20:06,880
Then God spake unto the fish, and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breaching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth, and vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

176
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:18,612
When the word of the Lord came a second time, Tim Jonah bruised and beaten his ears like two seashells, still multitudinously murmuring,

177
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,154
And what was that, shipmates?

178
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:23,378
To preach the truth to the face of falsehood.

179
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:24,179
That was it?

180
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:31,990
This, shipmates, this is that other lesson, and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it!

181
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,815
Woe to him whom this world charms from gospel duty!

182
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:40,981
Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters, when God has brewed them, into a gale!

183
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:45,207
Woe to him who seeks to please, rather than to appall!

184
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:49,012
Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness!

185
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:53,097
Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor!

186
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:57,803
Woe to him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation!

187
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:06,013
Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilate Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!

188
00:21:05,993 --> 00:21:15,342
He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment, then lifting his face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm.

189
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:28,714
But oh, shipmates, on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a sure delight, and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.

190
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:32,558
Is not the main truck higher than the kelson is low?

191
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:44,062
Delight is to him a far, far upward and inward delight who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self.

192
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:48,792
Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him.

193
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:53,016
when the ship of this base, treacherous world has gone down beneath him.

194
00:21:53,116 --> 00:22:04,327
Delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin, though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges.

195
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:14,577
Delight, top-gallant delight, is to him who acknowledges no law or Lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to Heaven.

196
00:22:14,557 --> 00:22:36,804
Delight is to him, whom all the waves Of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob Can never shake from this sure keel of the ages, And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, Who, coming to lay him down, can say, with his final breath, O Father, chiefly known to me by thy rod mortal or immortal, Here I die.

197
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:41,830
I have striven to be thine more than to be this world's or mine own.

198
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,120
Yet this is nothing, gal, I leave eternity to thee.

199
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:49,855
For what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?"

200
00:22:50,036 --> 00:23:02,856
He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his hands, and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed, and he was left alone in the place.
