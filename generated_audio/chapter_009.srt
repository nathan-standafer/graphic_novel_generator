1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:08,432
Chapter 9 - The Sermon. Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense.

2
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:10,397
Starboard gangway there.

3
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:11,960
Side away to larboard.

4
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:13,865
Larboard gangway to starboard.

5
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:14,767
Midships!

6
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:16,251
Midships!

7
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:24,981
There was a low rumbling of heavy sea boots among the benches and a still slider shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quiet again and every eye on the preacher.

8
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:39,977
He paused a little, then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea.

9
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:47,647
This ended in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog.

10
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:57,980
In such tones he commenced reading the following hymn, but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas, burst forth with appealing exultation and joy.

11
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:09,255
The ribs and tears in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom, while all God's sunlit waves rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom.

12
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:16,242
I saw the opening maw of hell, with endless pains and sorrows there which none but they that feel can tell.

13
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:18,804
Oh, I was plunging to despair.

14
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:23,669
In black distress I called my God when I could scarce believe Him mine.

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,011
He bowed His ear to my complaints.

16
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:28,574
No more the whale did me confine.

17
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:37,943
With speed He flew to my relief, as on a radiant dolphin born, awful yet bright, as lightning shone, the face of my Deliverer God.

18
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:42,155
My song forever shall record that terrible, that joyful hour.

19
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:46,319
I give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.

20
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,884
Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling of the storm.

21
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,826
A brief pause ensued.

22
00:01:53,866 --> 00:02:06,158
The preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said, Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah.

23
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:09,282
and God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.

24
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:18,556
Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters, four yarns, is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures.

25
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:22,602
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sea-line sound?

26
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:25,726
What a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet!

27
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:29,952
What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish's belly!

28
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:32,496
How billow-like and boisterously grand!

29
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:35,121
We feel the floods surging over us.

30
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,246
We sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters.

31
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:41,532
Seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us.

32
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:45,198
But what is this lesson that the Book of Jonah teaches?

33
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:54,454
Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson, a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.

34
00:02:54,653 --> 00:03:08,772
As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally, the deliverance and joy of Jonah.

35
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:15,901
As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his willful disobedience of the command of God.

36
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:22,129
Never mind now what that command was or how conveyed, which he found a hard command.

37
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:25,475
But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do.

38
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:26,456
Remember that?

39
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:30,083
And hence, He oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.

40
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:34,069
And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves.

41
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,679
And it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.

42
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:45,794
With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts a god by seeking to flee from him.

43
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:52,404
He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign, but only the captains of this earth.

44
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:57,692
He skulks about the wharves of Joppa and seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish.

45
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,699
There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here.

46
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,426
By all accounts, Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Kidiz.

47
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:08,419
That's the opinion of learned men.

48
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,741
And where is Cadiz, shipmates?

49
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:20,751
Cadiz is in Spain, as far by water from Joppa as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.

50
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:34,405
Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian, and Tarshish, or Cadiz, more than 2,000 miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar.

51
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:38,650
See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee worldwide from God?

52
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:39,872
Miserable man!

53
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:52,168
Oh, most contemptible and worthy of all scorn, with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God, prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas.

54
00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:03,362
So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck.

55
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,232
How plainly he's a fugitive!

56
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:09,298
No baggage, not a hatbox, valise, or carpetbag.

57
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:12,203
No friends accompany him to the wharf with their ado.

58
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:28,168
At last, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo, and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the stranger's evil eye.

59
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:35,197
Jonah sees this, but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence, in vain essays his wretched smile.

60
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:39,803
Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.

61
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:46,571
In their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other, Jack, he's robbed a widow.

62
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:48,594
Or, Joe, do you mark him?

63
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:49,995
He's a bigamist.

64
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,001
Or, hairy lad, I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah.

65
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:57,565
Or, be like, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.

66
00:05:57,545 --> 00:06:08,978
Another runs to read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering 500 gold coins for the apprehension of a parasite and containing a description of his person.

67
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:17,327
He reads and looks from Jonah to the bill, while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him.

68
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:24,615
Frighted, Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.

69
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:28,825
He will not confess himself suspected, but that itself is strong suspicion.

70
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:36,723
So he makes the best of it, and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.

71
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,267
Who's there?

72
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,364
cries the captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his papers for the customs.

73
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:44,405
Who's there?

74
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,948
Oh, how that harmless question mangles Jonah!

75
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,572
For the instant he almost turns to flee again, but he rallies.

76
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:54,195
I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish.

77
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:55,536
How soon sail ye, sir?

78
00:06:56,197 --> 00:07:06,027
Thus far the busy captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him, but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance.

79
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,967
We sail with the next coming tide.

80
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:11,077
At last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him.

81
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,260
No sooner, sir?

82
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:15,429
Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.

83
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,031
Ha!

84
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:17,816
Jonah, that's another stab.

85
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:20,725
But he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent.

86
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,103
I'll sail with ye, he says, the passage money.

87
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:25,244
How much is that?

88
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:26,466
I'll pay now.

89
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:35,415
For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail.

90
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:38,479
And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.

91
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,147
Now Jonah's captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.

92
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:51,353
In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely.

93
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:56,166
and without a passport, whereas virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers.

94
00:07:56,828 --> 00:08:01,480
So Jonah's captain prepares to test the length of Jonah's purse ere he judge him openly.

95
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,385
He charges him openly.

96
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:07,536
He charges him thrice the usual sum, and it's assented to.

97
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:14,686
Then the captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive, but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold.

98
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:20,013
Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the captain.

99
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,616
He wrings every coin to find a counterfeit.

100
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:27,442
Not a forger anyway, he mutters, and Jonah is put down for his passage.

101
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,687
Point out my stateroom, sir, says Jonah now.

102
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:31,848
I'm travel-weary.

103
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:32,910
I need sleep.

104
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,413
Thou lookest like it, says the captain.

105
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,135
There's thy room.

106
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:41,306
Jonah enters and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key.

107
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:50,738
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked within.

108
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:59,730
All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead.

109
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:02,069
The air is close and Jonah gasps.

110
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:15,475
Then, in that contracted hole, sunk too, beneath the ship's waterline, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels' wards.

111
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:38,428
Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah's room, and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room, though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung.

112
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:45,158
The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah, as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place,

113
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:49,724
and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.

114
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:53,149
But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appalls him.

115
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,233
The floor, the ceiling, and the side are all awry.

116
00:09:56,253 --> 00:10:01,741
Oh, so my conscience hangs in me, he groans, straight upwards, so it burns.

117
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:14,318
But the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness, like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the Roman racehorse.

118
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:37,097
but so much the more strike his steel tags into him, as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed, and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there's naught to staunch it.

119
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:44,305
So, after sore wrestlings in his birth, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.

120
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,990
and now the time of tide has come.

121
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:55,241
The ship casts off her cables, and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea.

122
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:59,466
That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers.

123
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:04,833
The contraband was Jonah, but the sea rebels, he will not bear the wicked burden.

124
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:12,823
A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break, but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her,

125
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:27,978
when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard, when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah's head, in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.

126
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:40,971
He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him.

127
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:49,049
Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship, a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep.

128
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:56,362
But the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear, What meanest thou, O sleeper, arise!

129
00:11:56,422 --> 00:12:06,840
Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea.

130
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:11,350
But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks.

131
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:21,505
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.

132
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:35,545
And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies and the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.

133
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:38,388
Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.

134
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:43,673
In all his cringing attitudes, the god fugitive is now too plainly known.

135
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:58,807
The sailors mark him, more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to High Heaven, they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them.

136
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:05,093
The lot is Jonah's, that discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions.

137
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,119
What is thine occupation?

138
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:08,620
Whence comest thou?

139
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,122
Thy country?

140
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:11,063
What people?

141
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:14,607
But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.

142
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:30,405
The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and wherefrom, whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.

143
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,270
I am a Hebrew, he cries.

144
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:37,566
And then, I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.

145
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:39,150
Fear him, O Jonah.

146
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:42,640
Ay, well mightest thou fear the Lord God then.

147
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:49,687
Straightway, he now goes on to make a full confession, whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful.

148
00:13:50,308 --> 00:14:10,146
For when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts, when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them, they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship.

149
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:13,211
But all in vain, the indignant gale howls louder.

150
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:19,661
Then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.

151
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:32,742
And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea, when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind.

152
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:46,041
He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shoots, to all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison.

153
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:49,687
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly.

154
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:57,658
But observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson, for sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance.

155
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,564
He feels that his dreadful punishment is just.

156
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:10,540
He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards his holy temple.

157
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:18,372
And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance, not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment.

158
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:24,844
And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.

159
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:33,480
Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin, but I do place him before you as a model for repentance.

160
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,149
Sin not, but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.

161
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:49,140
While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm-without seemed to add new power to the preacher who, when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.

162
00:15:49,780 --> 00:16:05,115
His deep chest heaved as with a groundswell, his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work, and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.

163
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:16,806
There now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves of the book once more, and, at last, standing motionless with closed eyes for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.

164
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:32,622
But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words, Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you, both his hands press upon me,

165
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:43,595
I have read ye by what murky light may be mine, the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners, and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye.

166
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:59,875
And now how gladly would I come down from this masthead, and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a pilot of the living God.

167
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:09,821
how being an anointed pilot prophet or speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh.

168
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:20,040
Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.

169
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:23,481
But God is everywhere, Tarshish he never reached.

170
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:42,383
As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of the seas, where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and the weeds were wrapped about his head, and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.

171
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:54,007
Yet even then, beyond the reach of any plummet, out of the belly of hell, when the whale grounded upon the ocean's utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulfed, repenting prophet when he cried.

172
00:17:54,507 --> 00:18:11,745
Then God spake unto the fish, and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breaching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth, and vomited out Jonah upon the dry land, when the word of the Lord came a second time, and Jonah bruised and beaten.

173
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:16,493
his ears like two seashells still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean.

174
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:20,921
Jonah did the Almighty's bidding, and what was that, shipmates?

175
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:24,267
To preach the truth to the face of falsehood.

176
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:26,170
That was it.

177
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:33,683
This, shipmates, this is that other lesson, and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it.

178
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:37,007
Woe to him whom this world charms from gospel duty!

179
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:42,534
Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale!

180
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:46,258
Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appall!

181
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,722
Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness!

182
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,667
Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor!

183
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:58,573
Woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation!

184
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:04,440
Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilate Paul has it, while preaching to others, is himself a castaway.

185
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:13,871
He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment, then lifting his face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm.

186
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:23,802
But oh, shipmates, on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight, and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep.

187
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:26,686
Is not the main truck higher than the Kelson is low?

188
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:38,181
Delight is to him, a far, far upward and inward delight, who, against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.

189
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:45,630
Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base, treacherous world has gone down beneath him.

190
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:52,219
Delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth and kills, burns, and destroys all sin.

191
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:55,225
though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges.

192
00:19:56,027 --> 00:20:04,204
Delight, top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven.

193
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:12,942
Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages.

194
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:25,036
And eternal delight and deliciousness will be His, who coming to lay Him down, can say with His final breath, O Father, chiefly known to me by Thy rod, mortal or immortal, here I die.

195
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:29,401
I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world's or mine own.

196
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,203
Yet this is nothing.

197
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:36,870
I leave eternity to Thee, for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?

198
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:47,451
He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he was left alone in the place.
