00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:09,385
CHAPTER XXXII CETOLOGY Already we are boldly launched upon the deep, but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harborless immensities.

2
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:17,618
E'er that come to pass, e'er the Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the Leviathan.

3
00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:31,767
At the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special Leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.

4
00:00:32,388 --> 00:00:37,800
It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera.

5
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,863
that I would now fain put before you.

6
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:42,106
Yet is it no easy task.

7
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:47,794
The classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less, is here essayed.

8
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,520
Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.

9
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,570
No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology," says Captain Scoresby, A.D.

10
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,451
1820.

11
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:07,940
It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the Cetacea into groups and families.

12
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:15,248
Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal hail, says Surgeon Beale, A.D.

13
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:15,788
1839.

14
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,473
Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.

15
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:24,357
Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the Cetacea.

16
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:27,801
A field strewn with thorns.

17
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:33,263
All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.

18
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:41,025
Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and lessen those lights of zoology and anatomy.

19
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:45,216
Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be little.

20
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:52,485
Yet of books there are aplenty, and so in some small degree, With cetology or the science of whales.

21
00:01:52,625 --> 00:02:01,256
Many are the men, small and great, old and new, Landsmen and seamen, who had at large or in little Written of the whale.

22
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:04,080
Run over a few to the authors of the Bible, eh, Aristotle?

23
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:05,702
Plenty, Aldrovandi.

24
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:28,956
Sir Thomas Brown Ghesneray Linnaeus Varnetius Willoughby Ginn Green Sir Balde Brison Martin Lassabede Boneteers Dess Marist Byron Cuvier Frederick Cuvier John Hunter Ohm Scoresby Bennett Gross Brown Varthartha Miriam Cuffin Ohms Eid Grev Dijon T. Cheever

25
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:41,591
But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above-cited extracts will show, of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever saw living whales.

26
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:48,699
And but one of them was a real professional harpooner and whaleman, I mean Captain Scoresby.

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,888
On the separate subject of the Greenland, or right whale, he is the best existing authority.

28
00:02:55,868 --> 00:03:04,441
but Scoresby knew nothing, and says nothing of the great sperm-whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning.

29
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:11,311
And here be it said that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.

30
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:15,377
He is not even by any means the largest of the whales.

31
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:21,066
Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which,

32
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:38,784
till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which, ignorance to this present day, still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports, tis usurpation has been every way complete.

33
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:50,395
Reference to nearly all the Leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.

34
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:54,045
But the time has at last come for a new proclamation.

35
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,131
This is Sharing-Cross.

36
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,220
Hear ye, good people, all!

37
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,328
The Greenland whale is deposed.

38
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,397
The great sperm-whale now reigneth.

39
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:16,060
There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm-whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree, succeed in the attempt.

40
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:25,140
Those books are Beal's and Bennett's, both in their time surgeons to English South Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men.

41
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:38,997
The original matter touching the sperm-whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small, but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description.

42
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:45,606
As yet, however, the sperm-whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature.

43
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:50,031
Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.

44
00:04:50,163 --> 00:05:04,632
Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular, comprehensive classification, if only an easy-outlined one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers.

45
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:08,560
As no better man advances to take this matter in hand,

46
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,443
I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors.

47
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:20,114
I promise nothing complete, because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty.

48
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:28,243
I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or in this place at least too much of any description.

49
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:34,811
My object here is simply to project the draft of a systematization of cetology.

50
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:38,175
I am the architect, not the builder.

51
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:54,560
But it is a ponderous task—no ordinary letter-sorter in the post-office is equal to it—to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them, to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world.

52
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:56,603
This is a fearful thing.

53
00:05:56,803 --> 00:06:00,729
What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this Leviathan?

54
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,855
The awful tauntings in Job might well appall me.

55
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:07,900
Will he, the Leviathan, make a covenant with thee?

56
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:10,524
Behold, the hope of him is vain.

57
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:14,350
But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans.

58
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:18,236
I have had to do with whales, with these visible hands.

59
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:21,641
I am in earnest, and I will try.

60
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:26,168
There are some preliminaries to settle, first soar.

61
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:37,804
The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of cytology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.

62
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,228
In his System of Nature, A.D.

63
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:49,641
1776, Linnaeus declares, I hereby separate the whales from the fish, but, of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,

64
00:06:49,891 --> 00:07:00,373
sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.

65
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:05,122
The grounds upon which Linnaeus would feign have banished the whales from the waters.

66
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,427
He states as follows.

67
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:21,346
on account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem interantem feminem mamis lactantem, and, finally, ex legis naturae e gerae marituc.

68
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:32,301
I submitted all this to my friends, Simeon Macy and Charlie Coffin, of Nantucket, both mess-mates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion

69
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,787
that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient.

70
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:49,277
Shirley profanely hinted they were humbug, be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old-fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon Holy Jonah to back me.

71
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:51,540
This fundamental thing settled.

72
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:57,709
The next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish?

73
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:07,564
Above, Linnaeus has given you those items, but in brief, they are these lungs and warm blood, whereas all other fish are lungless and cold-blooded.

74
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:16,497
Next case, how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come?

75
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:21,324
To be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail.

76
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:23,507
There you have him.

77
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:28,454
However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.

78
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:35,303
A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious.

79
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:41,151
But the last term of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.

80
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:58,313
Almost anyone must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical or up-and-down tail, whereas among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.

81
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:17,723
By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the Leviathanic Brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best-informed Nantucketers, nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.

82
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:26,376
For, hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal-tailed fish must be included in this ground plan of cetology.

83
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:30,651
Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.

84
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:43,764
I am aware that down to the present time the fish-styled llamatins and dugongs, fig-fish and sow-fish, of the coffins of Nantucket, are included by many naturalists among the whales.

85
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:55,215
But as these big fish are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay, and, especially as they do not spout,

86
00:09:55,195 --> 00:10:02,806
I deny their credentials as whales, and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cytology.

87
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:12,861
I. According to magnitude, I divide the whales into three primary books, subdivisible into chapters, and these shall comprehend them all, both small and large.

88
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:14,023
1.

89
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:15,505
The Folio Whale.

90
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:16,126
1.

91
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:17,488
The Octava Whale.

92
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:18,129
2.

93
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:19,431
The Tordesimu Whale.

94
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:28,497
As the type of the folio, I present the sperm whale of the octavo, the grampus of the doidecimo, the propoise, folios.

95
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:37,437
Among these, I here include the following chapters, cacao ma, the sperm whale, and I, the right whale, the finback whale, fine.

96
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,881
Sperm Whale.

97
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:57,231
This whale, among the English of old, vaguely known as the Trumper Whale, and the Physeter Whale, and the Anvil-Headed Whale, is the present cacalot of the French.

98
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,765
and the Potsvich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words.

99
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:21,883
He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe, the most formidable of all whales to encounter, the most majestic in aspect, and, lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce, he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained.

100
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:27,589
All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon.

101
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:30,652
It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do.

102
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:33,875
Philologically considered, it is absurd.

103
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:57,458
Some centuries ago, when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish, in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale.

104
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:07,582
It was the idea, also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses.

105
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:18,059
In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament.

106
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,648
It was only to be had from the druggists, as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb.

107
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:38,811
When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermiceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers, no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity.

108
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:46,063
And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermiceti was really derived.

109
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:50,209
Book I Folio, Chapter II

110
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:59,079
right whale, to live in one respect, this is the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted by man.

111
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:08,728
It yields the article commonly known as whale bone or baleen, and the oil specially known as whale oil, an inferior article in commerce.

112
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:18,897
Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles, the whale, the Greenland, whale, the black whale, the great whale,

113
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:21,321
The true whale, the right whale.

114
00:13:21,943 --> 00:13:28,434
There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptized.

115
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:34,024
What, then, is the whale, which I include in the second species of my folios?

116
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:41,037
It is the great mysticitous of the English naturalists, the Greenland whale of the English whalemen.

117
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:47,214
the balien ordinaire of the French whalemen, the groundlands wallfish of the Swedes.

118
00:13:47,414 --> 00:13:54,553
It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas.

119
00:13:55,951 --> 00:14:10,547
It is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian Ocean, on the Brazil banks, on the Norwest coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.

120
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:22,279
Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland Whale of the English and the Right Whale of the Americans, but they precisely agree in all their grand features,

121
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:29,587
Nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction.

122
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:40,358
It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate.

123
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:47,566
The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm-whale.

124
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:49,428
Book I. Folio.

125
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:50,349
Chapter III.

126
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:51,270
FINBECK.

127
00:14:51,250 --> 00:15:07,420
Under this head I reckon a monster, which, by the various names of Finback, Talspout, and Long John, has been seen almost in every sea, and is commonly the whale, whose distant jet is so often described by passengers crossing the Atlantic,

128
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,484
in the New York packet tracks.

129
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:21,225
In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the finback resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive.

130
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:29,239
His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles,

131
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:36,492
His grand distinguishing feature, the fin from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object.

132
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:47,312
This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.

133
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:57,504
Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.

134
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:08,878
When the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface,

135
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:18,719
It may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines grained on it.

136
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,792
On that Ahas dial the shadow often goes back, the finback is not gregarious,

137
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:48,213
He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters, Very shy, always going solitary, Unexpectedly rising to the surface In the remotest and most sullen waters, Hiss straight, and single lofty jet rising Like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain, Gifted with such wondrous power And velocity in swimming, as to defy All present pursuit from man.

138
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:53,378
This, Leviathan, seems the banished And unconquerable cane of his race,

139
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:56,095
bearing for his mark that style upon his back.

140
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:09,797
From having the baleen in his mouth, the finback is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic species denominated whale-bone whales, that is, whales with baleen.

141
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:16,971
Of these so-called whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known.

142
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:29,355
Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales, pike-headed whales, bunched whales, underjawed whales, and rostrated whales are the fishermen's names for a few sorts.

143
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:47,901
In connection with this appellative of whale-borne whales, it is of great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth.

144
00:17:47,881 --> 00:18:09,973
Notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cytology than any other detached bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds present, how, then, the baleen, hump, back fin, and teeth, these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,

145
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:16,604
without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars.

146
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:23,775
Thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases.

147
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,962
Then the same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale

148
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:36,073
Each of these has baleen, but there again the similitude ceases, and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned.

149
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:47,908
In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations, or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation, as utterly

150
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:52,093
to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis.

151
00:18:52,314 --> 00:19:07,372
On this rock every one of the whale naturalists has split, but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the whale, in his anatomy there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification.

152
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:15,162
Nay, what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen?

153
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:21,433
Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale.

154
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:30,028
And if you descend into the bowels, nothing but to take hold of the whale's bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.

155
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:38,803
And this is the bibliographical system here adopted, and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable.

156
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:39,706
proceed.

157
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:40,687

159
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:42,909
HUMP BACK.

160
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,013
This whale is often seen on the northern American coast.

161
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:51,197
He has been frequently captured there and towed into harbor.

162
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:56,943
He has a great pack on him like a peddler, or you might call him the elephant and castle whale.

163
00:19:57,584 --> 00:20:06,613
At any rate, the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has a hump, though a smaller one.

164
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:08,298
His oil is not very valuable.

165
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,083
He has baleen.

166
00:20:10,264 --> 00:20:17,685
He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.

167
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:18,949
Book One

168
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:25,394
FOLIO CHAPTER V RAZOR BACK Of this whale little is known but his name.

169
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:28,478
I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn.

170
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,922
Of a retiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers.

171
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:38,090
Though no coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a long, sharp ridge.

172
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,211
Let him go.

173
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:42,675
I know little more of him, nor does anybody else.

174
00:20:44,461 --> 00:21:10,705
Book 1 BULIO CHAPTER VI SULPHURBOTTOM.COM

175
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:13,207
Wood run away with rope-walks of line.

176
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:15,229
Prodigies are told of him.

177
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,351
Adieu, sulphur-bottom.

178
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:21,355
I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.

179
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:25,438
Thus ends Book One, Folio, and now begins Book Two.

180
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,981
Octavo, Octavoes.

181
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:40,692
Who, Thesimus, embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which presently be numbered to I, the grampus says I, the blackfish not too, the nur whale, the thrasher, the fifth, the killer?

182
00:21:40,672 --> 00:22:04,627
Why this Book of Whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain, because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet the Bookbinder's Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.

183
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:06,390
Vast Book II.

184
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:07,631
Octavo.

185
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:08,653
Chapter 1.

186
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:10,155
Grampus.

187
00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:22,105
Though this fish, whose loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly classed among whales.

188
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:29,131
But, possessing all the grand distinctive features of the Leviathan, most naturalists have recognized him for one.

189
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:39,400
He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist.

190
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:46,423
He swims in herds he has never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light.

191
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:53,085
By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.

192
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:58,081
Black fish!

193
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:03,836
I give the popular fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.

194
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:10,855
Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and suggest another.

195
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:17,386
I do so now, touching the black fish, so called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales.

196
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:21,152
So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please.

197
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:32,570
His voracity is well known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelian grin on his face.

198
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:37,939
This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length.

199
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,441
He is found in almost all latitudes.

200
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:48,048
He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose.

201
00:23:48,228 --> 00:24:07,926
When not more profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.

202
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:13,553
Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.

203
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:21,183
Book 2 Octabo Chapter 3 Narhal, that is, Nostril Whale.

204
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:29,813
Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named, I suppose, from his peculiar horn, being originally mistaken for a peaked nose.

205
00:24:29,973 --> 00:24:32,817
The creature is some sixteen feet in length.

206
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:39,488
while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet.

207
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:48,662
Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal.

208
00:24:48,642 --> 00:24:58,334
but it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man.

209
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:04,643
What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say.

210
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:18,160
It does not seem to be used like the blade of the swordfish and billfish, though some sailors tell me that the narwhal employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food.

211
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:31,365
Charlie Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer for the narwhal rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up and so breaks through.

212
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:35,794
But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct.

213
00:25:35,774 --> 00:25:48,398
My own opinion is that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the narwhal, however, that may be it, would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.

214
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:55,251
The narwhal I have heard called the tusked whale, the horned whale, and the unicorn whale.

215
00:25:55,315 --> 00:26:02,587
He is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature.

216
00:26:03,168 --> 00:26:17,931
From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and, as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.

217
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:26,559
It was also distilled to abolital salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into heart's horn.

218
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,444
Originally it was in itself a counted and object of great curiosity.

219
00:26:32,544 --> 00:26:46,197
Black letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher, on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jeweled hand to him from a window of Gurnidge Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames,

220
00:26:46,177 --> 00:27:00,338
When Sir Martin returned from that voyage, saith Blackletter, on bended knees he presented to Her Highness a prodigious long horn of the Nurwell, which, for a long period after, hung in the castle at Windsor.

221
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:14,248
An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to Her Highness another horn, pertaining to a land-beast of the unicorn nature.

222
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:19,980
The narwhal has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white grand colour,

223
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,147
dotted with round and oblong spots of black.

224
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:30,023
His oil is very superior, clear and fine, but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted.

225
00:27:30,745 --> 00:27:36,518
He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.

226
00:27:37,983 --> 00:27:45,413
KILLER Of this whale little is precisely known to the Ned Tucketer, and nothing at all to the professed Naturalist.

227
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:51,201
From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that he was about the bigness of a Grampus.

228
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,785
He is very savage, a sort of Fiji fish.

229
00:27:54,466 --> 00:28:02,657
He sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.

230
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:04,540
The killer is never hunted.

231
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:07,265
I never heard what sort of oil he has.

232
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:18,202
Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness, for we are all killers, on land and on sea, Bonapartes and sharks included.

233
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:19,785
Book Two

234
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:20,626
OCAVO.

235
00:28:21,127 --> 00:28:22,730
CHAPTER V. THRASHER.

236
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:28,639
This gentleman is famous for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.

237
00:28:29,381 --> 00:28:39,998
He mounts the folio whale's back, and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him, as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process.

238
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:43,343
Still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer,

239
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:45,787
Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.

240
00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:47,270
Thus ends Book Two.

241
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:49,954
Octavo, and begins Book Three.

242
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:51,798
Duodecimo.

243
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:53,220
These include the smaller whales.

244
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:55,744
I, the Husa porpoise.

245
00:28:55,765 --> 00:28:57,387
II, the Algerine porpoise.

246
00:28:57,908 --> 00:29:01,855
III, the mealy-mouthed porpoise.

247
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:18,679
To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among whale as a word, which, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.

248
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:29,232
But the creatures set down above, as duodecimos, are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition of what a whale is, i.e., a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.

249
00:29:30,177 --> 00:29:32,247
