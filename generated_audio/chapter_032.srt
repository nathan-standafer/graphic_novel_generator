CHAPTER XXXII - CITOLOGY

3
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:09,624
Already we are boldly launched upon the deep, but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities.

4
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:29,532
Ere they come to pass, ere the Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the Leviathan, at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special Leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.

5
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:35,759
It is some systematized exhibition of the whale and his broad genera that I would now fain put before you.

6
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:38,101
Yet is it no easy task.

7
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:43,006
The classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less, is here essayed.

8
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:46,490
Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.

9
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:53,978
No branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled cetology, says Captain Scoresby, A.D.

10
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:54,659
1820.

11
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:58,523
It is not my intention, were it in my power,

12
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:04,051
to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families.

13
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:08,135
Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal.

14
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:11,239
Sperm whale, says Surgeon Beale, A.D.

15
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,000
1839.

16
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:16,605
Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.

17
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:20,529
Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,912
A field strewn with thorns.

19
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:27,717
All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.

20
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:35,245
thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy.

21
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:45,356
Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are aplenty, and so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales.

22
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:53,805
Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little written of the whale.

23
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:55,136
Run over a few.

24
00:01:55,756 --> 00:02:24,282
The authors of the Bible, Aristotle, Pliny, Aldrovandi, Sir Thomas Brown, Gesner, Ray, Linnaeus, Rondeledius, Willoughby, Green, Artede, Sybild, Brisson, Martin, Lacepede, Brisson, Martin, Lacepede, Bonneter, Desmarest, Baron Cuvier, Frederick Cuvier, John Hunter, Owen, Scoresby, Beale, Bennett, J. Ross Brown, the author of Miriam Coffin, Olmsted, and the Reventi

25
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:30,852
But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above-cited extracts will show.

26
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:42,210
Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever saw living whales, and but one of them was a real professional harpooner and whaleman—I mean Captain Scoresby.

27
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:47,518
On the separate subject of the Greenland or right whale, he is the best existing authority.

28
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:54,390
But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning.

29
00:02:54,991 --> 00:03:00,140
And here be it said that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.

30
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,706
He is not even by any means the largest of the whales.

31
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:11,599
Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back,

32
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:24,470
invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale ports, this usurpation has been every way complete.

33
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:36,340
Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.

34
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,624
But the time has at last come for a new proclamation.

35
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:42,893
This is Charing Cross, hear ye.

36
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,776
Good people all, the Greenland whale is deposed.

37
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:49,079
The great sperm whale now reigneth.

38
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:59,108
There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree, succeed in the attempt.

39
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:08,957
Those books are Beal's and Bennett's, both in their time surgeons to English South Sea whale ships, and both exact and reliable men.

40
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:20,689
The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small, but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description.

41
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:28,156
As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature.

42
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:33,882
Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.

43
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:46,432
Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers.

44
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:53,963
As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors.

45
00:04:54,664 --> 00:05:02,856
I promise nothing complete, because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty.

46
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:11,963
I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or, in this place at least, to much of any description.

47
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:17,652
My object here is simply to project the draft of a systematization of cytology.

48
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:20,997
I am the architect, not the builder.

49
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:26,461
But it is a ponderous task, no ordinary letter-sorter in the post-office is equal to it.

50
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:37,242
To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them, to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world, this is a fearful thing.

51
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:41,871
What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this Leviathan?

52
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:45,070
The awful tauntings in Job might well appall me.

53
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,216
Will he, the Leviathan, make a covenant with thee?

54
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:50,500
Behold, the hope of him is vain.

55
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:54,046
But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans.

56
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:57,132
I have had to do with whales with these visible hands.

57
00:05:57,753 --> 00:05:59,877
I am in earnest, and I will try.

58
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,474
There are some preliminaries to settle.

59
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:14,616
First, the uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.

60
00:06:15,518 --> 00:06:17,522
In his System of Nature, A.D.

61
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:23,653
776, Linnaeus declares, I hereby separate the whales from the fish.

62
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:36,546
But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus' express edict, were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.

63
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:55,885
The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters, he states as follows, on account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penum entrentem feminam mamis lactantem, and finally, ex legae naturae jure maritoc.

64
00:06:56,067 --> 00:07:07,601
I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macy and Charlie Coffin of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient.

65
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:10,544
Charlie profanely hinted they were humbug.

66
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:18,614
Be it known that, waving all argument, I take the good old-fashioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon Holy Jonah to back me.

67
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:20,556
This fundamental thing settled.

68
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:25,382
The next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish?

69
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:28,346
Above, Linnaeus has given you those items.

70
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:35,458
But in brief, they are these, lungs and warm blood, whereas all other fish are lungless and cold-blooded.

71
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:43,291
Next, how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come?

72
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:48,419
To be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail.

73
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,222
There you have him.

74
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:54,168
However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.

75
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:59,776
A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious.

76
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:04,543
But the last term of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.

77
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:13,155
Almost anyone must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.

78
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:21,023
whereas, among spouting fish, the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.

79
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:38,147
By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the Leviathanic Brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best-informed Nantucketers, nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.

80
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:44,993
Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal-tailed fish must be included in this ground plan of cetology.

81
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:49,487
Now then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.

82
00:08:49,552 --> 00:09:01,202
I am aware that down to the present time, the fish-styled llamatins and dugongs—pigfish and sowfish of the coffins of Nantucket—are included by many naturalists among the whales.

83
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:18,597
But as these pigfish are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales, and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology.

84
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:28,683
First, according to magnitude, I divide the whales into three primary books, subdivisible into chapters, and these shall comprehend them all, both small and large.

85
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:31,347
I, the folio whale, 7.

86
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:33,711
The ocetavo whale, 3rd.

87
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:35,594
The duodecamo whale.

88
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:43,187
As the type of the folio I present the sperm whale, of the ocetavo, the grampus, of the duodecamo, the porpoise.

89
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,090
Folios.

90
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,852
Among these I here include the following chapters.

91
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:50,356
I. The Sperm Whale, 7.

92
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,299
The Right Whale, 3rd.

93
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,401
The Theban.

94
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:54,743
The 3rd Cap.

95
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:56,065
The Theban Back Whale.

96
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:58,769
I. The Fem Back Whale.

97
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,291
The Hump.

98
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:02,996
Backed Whale V. The Razorback Whale V.I.

99
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:04,598
The Sulphur Bottom Whale.

100
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:08,198
Book I, Folio, Chapter I, Sperm Whale.

101
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:20,880
This whale among the English of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale, and the physitor whale, and the anvil-headed whale, is the present catch-a-load of the French, and the pots-fish of the Germans, and the macrocephalus of the long words.

102
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:25,067
He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe.

103
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:40,011
the most formidable of all whales to encounter, the most majestic in aspect, and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce, he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained.

104
00:10:40,952 --> 00:10:45,199
All his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged upon.

105
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:48,157
It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do.

106
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,463
Philologically considered, it is absurd.

107
00:10:52,264 --> 00:11:11,575
Some centuries ago, when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish, in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or right whale.

108
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:20,673
It was the idea, also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland whale, which the first syllable of the word literally expresses.

109
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:29,310
In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament.

110
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:33,927
It was only to be had from the druggists, as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb.

111
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:47,763
When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers, no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity.

112
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:55,031
And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.

113
00:11:56,352 --> 00:11:57,053
Book 1.

114
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:14,971
right whale.

115
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:21,723
In one respect, this is the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted by man.

116
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:32,001
It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen, and the oil specially known as whale oil, an inferior article in commerce.

117
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:37,081
Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles.

118
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:43,909
The Whale, The Greenland Whale, The Black Whale, The Great Whale, The Great Whale, The True Whale, The Right Whale.

119
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,676
There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species, thus multitudinously baptized.

120
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:55,002
What then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my folios?

121
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:05,051
It is the great mysticetus of the English naturalists, the Greenland whale of the English whalemen, the baleen ordinaire of the French whalemen, the growlins wallfish of the Swedes.

122
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:12,366
It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas.

123
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:24,963
It is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian Ocean, on the Brazil banks, on the Norse West Coast, and various other parts of the world designated by them, right whale cruising grounds.

124
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:31,531
Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans.

125
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:41,965
But they precisely agree in all their grand features, nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction.

126
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:57,459
It is by endless subdivisions, based upon the most inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate, the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.

127
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,042
Book.

128
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:00,703
Opholio.

129
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:01,865
Chapter 3.

130
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:03,126
Fin.

131
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:04,408
Back.

132
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:22,108
Under this head I reckon a monster which, by the various names of finback, tallspout, and longjawn, has been seen almost in every sea, and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often described by passengers crossing the Atlantic in the New York packet tracks.

133
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:32,320
In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the finback resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth and a lighter color approaching to olive.

134
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:39,501
His great lips present a cable-like aspect formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.

135
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:46,969
His grand distinguishing feature, the fin from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object.

136
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:57,700
This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end.

137
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:06,832
Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.

138
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:24,919
When the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hour lines graved on it.

139
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,395
On that aha's dial the shadow often goes back.

140
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:34,250
The fin, back is not gregarious, he seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters.

141
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:42,001
Very shy, always going solitary, unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters.

142
00:15:42,762 --> 00:15:55,480
His straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain, gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man,

143
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:03,112
This leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cane of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.

144
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:13,089
From having the baleen in his mouth, the finback is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales, that is, whales with baleen.

145
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:20,100
Of these so-called whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known.

146
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:31,948
Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales, pike-headed whales, bunched whales, underjawed whales, and rostrated whales are the fishermen's names for a few sorts, are the fishermen's names for a few sorts.

147
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:37,617
In connection with this appellative of whalebone whales, it is of great importance to mention

148
00:16:37,597 --> 00:17:05,167
that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth, notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.

149
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:06,709
How then?

150
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:10,471
the baleen, hump, back fin, and teeth.

151
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:20,901
These are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars.

152
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:26,857
Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump, but there the similitude ceases.

153
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:34,777
Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen, but there again the similitude ceases.

154
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:39,328
And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned.

155
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:52,640
In various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations, or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation, as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis.

156
00:17:53,701 --> 00:18:06,953
On this rock every one of the whale naturalists has split, but it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in his anatomy, there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification.

157
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:12,960
Nay, what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen?

158
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:17,900
Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale.

159
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:30,334
And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions, a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated.

160
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:31,775
What then remains?

161
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:39,083
Nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way.

162
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:46,939
And this is the bibliographical system here adopted, and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable.

163
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,262
To Proceed.

164
00:18:49,023 --> 00:18:49,504
Book 1.

165
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:50,626
Folio.

166
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:51,889
Chapter 4.

167
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,971
Humpback.

168
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,004
This whale is often seen on the northern American coast.

169
00:18:57,485 --> 00:19:00,309
He has been frequently captured there and towed into harbor.

170
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,837
He has a great pack on him like a peddler, or you might call him the elephant and castle whale.

171
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:13,648
At any rate, the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has a hump, though a smaller one.

172
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:16,292
His oil is not very valuable.

173
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:17,477
He has baleen.

174
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,793
He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.

175
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:26,766
Book 1.

176
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:30,991
Folio, Chapter V. Razor, Back.

177
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:34,035
Of this whale little is known but his name.

178
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,658
I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn.

179
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,984
Of a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers.

180
00:19:41,624 --> 00:19:47,672
Though no coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a long, sharp ridge.

181
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:48,934
Let him go.

182
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,438
I know little more of him, nor does anybody else.

183
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:30,376
He is seldom seen, at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then always a too great a distance to study his countenance.

184
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:35,204
He is never chased, he would run away with rope walks of line, prodigies are told of him.

185
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:41,474
Adieu, Sulphur Bottom, I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.

186
00:20:42,014 --> 00:20:43,637
Thus ends Book One.

187
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:48,654
Folio, and now begins book one.

188
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,246
OCTO.

189
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:52,260
OCTO.

190
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:15,563
tae sea, these embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which present may be numbered, I, the grampus, II, the blacst, III, the narwhal, ife, the thrasher, V, the killer.

191
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:20,273
Why this book of whales is not denominated, the quarto is very plain.

192
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:35,983
Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet the bookbinder's quarto volume, in its dimensioned form, does not preserve the shape of the folio volume, but the octavo volume does.

193
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:57,504
OCTAVO CHAPTER I. GRAMPUS Though this fish, whose loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly classed among whales.

194
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:05,278
But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognized him for one.

195
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:13,166
He is of moderate octavo size, varying from 15 to 25 feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist.

196
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:14,949
He swims in herds.

197
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:20,900
He is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light.

198
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:26,710
By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.

199
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,941
Book 2.

200
00:22:28,822 --> 00:22:29,863
O.C.Tievo.

201
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:30,964
Chapter 2.

202
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:32,385
Black.

203
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:32,726
Fish.

204
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:37,731
I give the popular fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.

205
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:43,197
Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so and suggest another.

206
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:50,404
I do so now, touching the black fish so-called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales.

207
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:52,026
So.

208
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:55,870
Call him the hyena whale if you please.

209
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:05,245
His veracity is well known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelian grin on his face.

210
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,952
This whale averages some 16 or 18 feet in length.

211
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:13,298
He is found in almost all latitudes.

212
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:21,030
He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal-hooped fin in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose.

213
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:39,222
When not more profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment, as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.

214
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:44,713
Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.

215
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:45,935
Book 2.

216
00:23:46,697 --> 00:23:47,178
O.C.T.

217
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:47,518
Evo.

218
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:48,580
Chapter 3.

219
00:23:49,001 --> 00:23:51,085
Narwhal, that is, Nostril Whale.

220
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:59,522
Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named, I suppose, from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose.

221
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:06,934
The creature is some 16 feet in length, while its horn averages 5 feet, though some exceed 10 and even attain to 15 feet.

222
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:15,368
Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal.

223
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:23,817
But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man.

224
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:29,065
What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say.

225
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:40,123
It does not seem to be used like the blade of the swordfish and billfish, though some sailors tell me that the narwhal employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food.

226
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:43,226
Charlie Coffin said it was used for an ice piercer.

227
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:51,659
For the narwhal, rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up and so breaks through.

228
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:55,785
But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct.

229
00:24:56,326 --> 00:25:07,663
My own opinion is that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the narwhal, however that may be, it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.

230
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:12,530
The narwhal I have heard called the tusked whale, the horned whale, and the unicorn whale.

231
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:18,639
He is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature.

232
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:32,740
From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.

233
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:40,574
It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into harchorn.

234
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:45,203
Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.

235
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:50,053
Black letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage,

236
00:25:50,033 --> 00:26:08,869
When Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jeweled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace as his bold ship sailed down the Thames, when Sir Martin returned from that voyage, saith Blackletter, on bended knees he presented to Her Highness a prodigious longhorn of the narwhal, which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.

237
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:18,701
An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to Her Highness another horn, pertaining to a land-beast of the unicorn nature.

238
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:27,371
The narwhal has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.

239
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:34,198
His oil is very superior, clear and fine, but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted.

240
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,530
He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.

241
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:37,631
Book 2.

242
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,516
O.C.T.Evo, Chapter 4.

243
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:41,598
Killer.

244
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:48,349
Of this whale, little is precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed naturalist.

245
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:54,178
From what I have seen of him at a distance I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus.

246
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:57,275
He is very savage, a sort of figgy fish.

247
00:26:57,957 --> 00:27:04,514
He sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brood is worried to death.

248
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:06,359
The killer is never hunted.

249
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,467
I never heard what sort of oil he has.

250
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:20,865
Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness, for we are all killers, on land and on sea, bonapartes and sharks included.

251
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:22,227

Eivor, Chapter V. Thrasher.

254
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:32,845
This gentleman is famous for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.

255
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:43,082
He mounts the folio whale's back, and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him, as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process.

256
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,686
Still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer.

257
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:48,370
Both are outlaws even in the lawless seas.

258
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,972
Thus ends Book Two.

The Mealy-mouthed porpoise.

270
00:28:06,957 --> 00:28:12,225
To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may possibly seem strange,

271
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:22,737
that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshaled among whales, a word which, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.

272
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:34,090
But the creatures set down above as duodecimos are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition of what a whale is, i.e., a spouting fish with a horizontal tail.

273
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:35,412
Book III.

274
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,242
Huzzah, porpoise!

275
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:52,249
This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe.

276
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:59,782
The name is of my own bestowal, for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something must be done to distinguish them.

277
00:29:00,623 --> 00:29:09,398
I call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth of July crowd.

278
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:13,059
Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner.

279
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,745
Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.

280
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,368
They are the lads that always live before the wind.

281
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:24,911
They are accounted a lucky omen.

282
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:36,162
If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye, the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye.

283
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:41,212
A well-fed, plump huzzah porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil.

284
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:47,043
But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable.

285
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:50,408
It is in request among jewelers and watchmakers.

286
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,053
Sailors put it on their honest.

287
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,931
Porpoise meat is good eating, you know.

288
00:29:54,951 --> 00:29:58,115
It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts.

289
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:02,782
Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible.

290
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:09,312
But the next time you have a chance, watch him, and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature."

Book 3.

00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:12,697
D. U. O. Deximo.

293
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:13,658
Chapter 2.

294
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,381
Algerian Porpoise.

295
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:16,422
A pirate.

296
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:17,784
Very savage.

297
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:21,049
He is only found, I think, in the Pacific.

298
00:30:21,282 --> 00:30:25,429
He is somewhat larger than the Huzzah porpoise, but much of the same general make.

299
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,313
Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark.

300
00:30:29,015 --> 00:30:32,280
I have lowered for him many times, but never yet saw him captured.

301
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:33,462
Book 3.

302
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:34,864
D.U.O.

303
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:36,306
Decamo, Chapter 3.

304
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,190
Mealy-mouthed porpoise.

305
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:43,999
The largest kind of porpoise, and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is known.

306
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:54,476
The only English name by which he has hitherto been designated is that of the Fisher's, right whale porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio.

307
00:30:55,077 --> 00:31:01,145
In shape he differs in some degree from the Hussar porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth.

308
00:31:01,746 --> 00:31:05,751
Indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentlemanlike figure.

309
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:09,028
He has no fins on his back, most other porpoises have.

310
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:13,734
He has a lovely tail and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue.

311
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:26,032
But his mealy mouth spoils all, though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary lime, distinct as the mark in a ship's hull called the bright waist.

312
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:33,122
That lime streaks him from stem to stern with two separate colors, black above and white below.

313
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:41,323
The white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal bag.

314
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:43,538
a most mean and mealy aspect.

315
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,742
His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.

316
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:53,992
Beyond the duodexamo, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales.

317
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,437
Above, you have all the leviathans of note.

318
00:31:57,998 --> 00:32:08,172
But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally.

319
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:18,303
I shall enumerate them by their four castle abolations, for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun.

320
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:34,159
If any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into this system, according to his folio, octavo or duodecimo magnitude, the bottlenose whale, the junk whale, the pudding,

321
00:32:35,084 --> 00:32:49,699
Headed Whale, The Cape Whale, The Leading Whale, The Cannon Whale, The Scrag Whale, The Scrag Whale, The Coppered Whale, The Coppered Whale, The Elephant Whale, The Elephant Whale, The Iceberg Whale, The Quag Whale, Sembard.

322
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:59,809
From Icelandic, Dutch, and Old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names.

323
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:09,495
But I omit them as altogether obsolete, and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of leviathanism, but signifying nothing.

324
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:16,102
Finally, it was stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected.

325
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:30,673
You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word, but I now leave my seedological system standing thus unfinished, even as the great cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.

326
00:33:30,738 --> 00:33:33,709
For small erections may be finished by their first architects.

327
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:37,664
Grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity.

328
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:40,736
God keep me from ever completing anything.

329
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:43,025
This whole book is but a draft.

330
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,313
Nay, but the draft of a draft.

331
00:33:45,996 --> 00:33:49,489
Oh, time, strength, cash, and patience.
