00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,455
Book 3, Telemachus Visits, Nestor, at Pylos.

2
00:00:04,576 --> 00:00:12,905
But as the sun was rising from the fair sea to Thor into the firmament of heaven to shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos, the city of Nelius.

3
00:00:13,786 --> 00:00:19,713
Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the seashore to offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune, lord of the earthquake.

4
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:25,279
There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were nine bulls to each guild.

5
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:36,687
As they were eating the inward meats 25 and burning the thigh bones on the embers in the name of Neptune, Telemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship to anchor, and went ashore.

6
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:39,491
Minerva led the way and Telemachus followed her.

7
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:44,500
Presently, she said, Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous.

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:52,912
You have taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how he came by his end, so go straight up to Nestor that we may see what he has got to tell us.

9
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:58,179
Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell no lies, for he is an excellent person.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,328
But how, mentor, replied Telemachus, dare I go up to Nestor, and how am I to address him?

11
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:12,259
I have never yet been used to holding long conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioning one who is so much older than myself.

12
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:22,595
Some things, Telemachus, answered Minerva, will be suggested to you by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further, for I am assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth until now.

13
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:29,581
She then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till they reached the place where the guilds of the Pilean people were assembled.

14
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:39,450
There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his company round him were busy getting dinner ready and putting pieces of meat onto the spits twenty-six while other pieces were cooking.

15
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:42,313
When they saw the strangers they crowded round them,

16
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:44,758
took them by the hand and bade them take their places.

17
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:54,476
Nestor's son Pisistratus at once offered his hand to each of them and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes.

18
00:01:55,237 --> 00:02:00,066
Then he gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them into a golden cup.

19
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:03,353
handing it to Minerva first and saluting her at the same time.

20
00:02:03,393 --> 00:02:14,094
Offer a prayer, sir, said he to King Neptune, for it is his feast that you are joining, when you have duly prayed and made your drink offering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also.

21
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:20,687
I doubt not that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without God in the world.

22
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:27,535
Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an age with myself, so I will give you the precedence."

23
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,978
As he spoke he handed her the cup.

24
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:33,983
Minerva thought it very right and proper of him to have given it to herself first.

25
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,948
Twenty-seven she accordingly began praying heartily to Neptune.

26
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:45,898
O thou, she cried, that encirclest the earth vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon thee.

27
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:49,924
More especially, we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor and on his sons.

28
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:55,894
Thereafter also make the rest of the Pilean people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you.

29
00:02:56,635 --> 00:03:03,145
Lastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matter that has brought us in our ship to Pylos.

30
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:08,417
When she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to Telemachus, and he prayed likewise.

31
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:16,492
By and by, when the outer meats were roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man his portion, and they all made an excellent dinner.

32
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:21,401
As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Jerene, began to speak.

33
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:26,550
Now, said he, that our guests have done their dinner, it will be best to ask them who they are.

34
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,395
"'Who then, sir strangers, are you, and from what port have you sailed?

35
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:37,304
Are you traders, or do you sail the seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man's hand against you?'

36
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:43,352
Telemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to ask about his father and get himself a good name.

37
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:47,537
"'Nestor,' said he, son of Nellius, "'honor to the Achaean name.

38
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,041
You ask whence we come, and I will tell you.

39
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:54,867
We come from Ithaca under Neritum, toate and the matter about which I would speak,

40
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:57,050
is of private, not public import.

41
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:03,358
I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is said to have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself.

42
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:22,103
We know what fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but as regards Ulysses' heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished, nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland or was lost at sea amid the waves of Amphitrite.

43
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:33,422
Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if happily you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end, whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller, for he was a man born to trouble.

44
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:39,231
Do not soften things out of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw."

45
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:51,431
If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans, bear it in mind now, as in my favor, and tell me truly all."

46
00:04:51,451 --> 00:05:00,325
"'My friend,' answered Nestor, "'you recall a time of much sorrow to my mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while privateering under Achilles,

47
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:02,847
and when fighting before the great city of King Priam.

48
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,609
Our best men, all of them fell there.

49
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:15,398
Ajax, Achilles, Patroclus, peer of gods and council, and my own dear son Antilochus, a man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.

50
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:20,062
But we suffered much more than this, what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story.

51
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:30,210
Though you were to stay here and question me for five years, or even six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended.

52
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,478
Nine long years did we try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us.

53
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:39,745
During all this time there was no one who could compare with your father in subtlety.

54
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:45,674
If indeed you are his son, I can hardly believe my eyes, and you talk just like him too.

55
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,562
No one would say that people of such different ages could speak so much alike.

56
00:05:50,542 --> 00:06:01,840
He and I never had any kind of difference from first to last, neither in camp nor council, but in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might be ordered for the best.

57
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:15,081
When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam and were setting sail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vex the Argives on their homeward voyage, for they had not all been either wise or understanding,

58
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:22,810
and hence many came to a bad end through the displeasure of Jove's daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrel between the two sons of Atreus.

59
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,777
The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine.

60
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:41,592
When they explained why they had called the people together, it seemed that Menelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased Agamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease the anger of Minerva.

61
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:48,308
Fool that he was, he might have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods have made up their minds they do not change them lightly.

62
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:57,042
So the two stood bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air, and were of two minds as to what they should do.

63
00:06:57,062 --> 00:07:01,848
That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching mischief against us.

64
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:11,680
But in the morning some of us drew our ships into the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest, about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon.

65
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,809
We, the other half, embarked and sailed, and the ships went well, for heaven had smoothed the sea.

66
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,818
When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the gods, for we were longing to get home.

67
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:33,398
Cruel Jove, however, did not yet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of which some among us turned their ships back again and sailed away under Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon.

68
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:38,467
But I and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was brewing.

69
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:42,134
The son of Tydeus went on also with me, and his crews with him.

70
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:56,601
Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us making up our minds about our course, for we did not know whether to go outside Chios by the island of Syra, keeping this to our left, or inside Chios, over against the stormy headland of Mimas.

71
00:07:56,581 --> 00:08:04,134
So we asked heaven for a sign, and were shown one to the effect that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across the open sea to Euboea.

72
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:15,433
This we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during the night to Geraistas town to Nain, where we offered many sacrifices to Netun for having helped us so far on our way.

73
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:24,867
Four days later, Diomed and his men stationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it fair for me.

74
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:29,394
Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything about the others.

75
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:39,750
I know neither who got home safely nor who were lost, but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports that have reached me since I have been here in my own house.

76
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:47,200
They say the Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles' son the Optolemus, so also did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes.

77
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:55,091
Idomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and all his followers who escaped death in the field got safe home with him to Crete.

78
00:08:55,792 --> 00:09:06,767
No matter how far out of the world you live, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of Aegisthus, and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently pay.

79
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:14,677
See what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as Orestes did, who killed false Aegisthus, the murderer of his noble father.

80
00:09:15,158 --> 00:09:20,585
You too, then, for you are a tall, smart-looking fellow show your mettle and make yourself a name in story."

81
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,729
Nesta, son of Naelius, answered Telemachus.

82
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:30,898
Honor to the Achaean name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through all time, for he has avenged his father nobly.

83
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:44,029
Would that heaven might grant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors who are ill-treating me and plotting my ruin, but the gods have no such happiness in store for me and for my father, so we must bear it as best we may.

84
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:53,898
My friend, said Nestor, now that you remind me, I remember to have heard that your mother has many suitors who are ill-disposed towards you and are making havoc of your estate.

85
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:59,603
Do you submit to this tamely, or a public feeling and the voice of heaven against you?

86
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:07,632
Who knows but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him.

87
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:24,852
If Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses when we were fighting before Troy, for I never yet saw the gods so openly fond of anyone as Minerva then was of your father, if she would take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would soon some of them forget their wooing.

88
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:28,476
Telemachus answered, I can expect nothing of the kind.

89
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,287
it would be far too much to hope for.

90
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:32,431
I dare not let myself think of it.

91
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:37,077
Even though the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me."

92
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:41,023
On this Minerva said, "'Telemachus, what are you talking about?

93
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:51,038
Heaven has a long arm if it is minded to save a man, and if it were me, I should not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I could be safe when I was once there."

94
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:58,352
I would rather this than get home quickly and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the treachery of Aegisthus and his wife.

95
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:06,327
Still, death is certain, and when a man's hour is come, not even the gods can save him, no matter how fond they are of him.

96
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:10,077
Mentor, answered Telemachus, do not let us talk about it anymore.

97
00:11:10,658 --> 00:11:13,145
There is no chance of my father's ever coming back.

98
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:15,791
The gods have long since counseled his destruction.

99
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:22,729
There is something else, however, about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much more than anyone else does.

100
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:26,876
They say he has reigned for three generations, so that it is like talking to an immortal.

101
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:31,845
Tell me therefore, Nestor, and tell me true, how did Agamemnon come to die in that way?

102
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:33,388
What was Menelaus doing?

103
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:37,695
And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better a man than himself?

104
00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:46,270
Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?

105
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:51,780
I will tell you truly, answered Nestor, and indeed you have yourself divined how it all happened.

106
00:11:52,441 --> 00:12:00,271
If Menelaus, when he got back from Troy, had found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead.

107
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:07,701
But he would have been thrown outside the city to doves and vultures, and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness.

108
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:17,449
But we were over there fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus, who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.

109
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,125
At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, for she was of a good natural disposition.

110
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:30,996
Thirty moreover there was a bard with her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy, that he was to keep guard over his wife.

111
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:42,733
But when heaven had cancelled her destruction, Aegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon, after which she went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus.

112
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:52,167
Then he offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods and decorated many temples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations.

113
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:56,612
Meanwhile, Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms with one another.

114
00:12:57,113 --> 00:13:17,867
When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens, Apollo with his painless shafts killed Frontis, the steersman of Menelaus' ship, and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather, so that he died then and there with the helm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites.

115
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:28,185
Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far as the Malian heads, Jove counseled evil against him and made it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high.

116
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:35,738
Here he divided his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the Sidonians dwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus.

117
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:51,111
There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called Gortin, and all along this part of the coast as far as Festus, the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but after Festus the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great shelter.

118
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:56,761
Here, this part of the fleet was driven onto the rocks and wrecked, but the crews just managed to save themselves.

119
00:13:57,502 --> 00:14:05,336
As for the other five ships, they were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and substance among people of an alien speech.

120
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:09,724
Meanwhile, Aegisthus here at home plotted his evil deed.

121
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:20,699
For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in Mycenae, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens to be his bane and killed the murderer of his father.

122
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:33,737
Then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and a false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus came home, thirty-one with as much treasure as his ships could carry.

123
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:41,011
Take my advice, then, and do not go traveling about for long so far from home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house.

124
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:45,620
They will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a fool's errand.

125
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:55,540
Still, I should advise you by all means to go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage among such distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from.

126
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,503
when the winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning.

127
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:01,747
Even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelve-month.

128
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,770
So vast and terrible are the seas that they must cross.

129
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:08,455
Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your own men with you.

130
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:16,784
Or if you would rather travel by land, you can have a chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to Lacedaemon, where Menelaus lives.

131
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:22,911
Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell you no lies, for he is an excellent person.

132
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:38,267
As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said, Sir, all that you have said is, well, now, however, order the tongues of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to Neptune and the other immortals, and then go to bed, for it is bedtime.

133
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:42,812
People should go away early and not keep late hours at a religious festival.

134
00:15:43,513 --> 00:15:46,276
Thus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying.

135
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:52,442
Men's servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water,

136
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:55,366
and handed it round after giving every man his drink offering.

137
00:15:55,827 --> 00:16:00,073
Then they threw the tongues of the victims into the fire and stood up to make their drink offerings.

138
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:09,807
When they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Minerva and Telemachus were forgoing on board their ship, but Nesta caught them up at once and stayed them.

139
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:15,636
"'Heaven and the immortal gods,' he exclaimed, "'forbid that you should leave my house "'to go on board of a ship.

140
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:24,570
"'Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes, "'or that I have so few cloaks, "'and as to be unable to find comfortable beds "'both for myself and for my guests?

141
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:37,971
"'Let me tell you, I have store both of rugs and cloaks, "'and shall not permit the son of my old friend Ulysses "'to camp down on the deck of a ship, "'not while I live, nor yet will my sons after me, "'but they will keep open house as I have done.

142
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:43,996
Then Minerva answered, Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much better that Telemachus should do as you have said.

143
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:50,882
He, therefore, shall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back to give orders to my crew and keep them in good heart.

144
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:53,204
I am the only older person among them.

145
00:16:53,704 --> 00:17:01,010
The rest are all young men of Telemachus's own age, who have taken this voyage out of friendship, so I must return to the ship and sleep there.

146
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:07,536
Moreover, tomorrow I must go to the Calconians, where I have a large sum of money long owing to me.

147
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:14,209
As for Telemachus, now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let one of your sons go with him.

148
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,877
Be pleased to also provide him with your best and fleetest horses."

149
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:23,668
When she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and all marveled as they beheld it.

150
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,782
Nestor was astonished and took Telemachus by the hand.

151
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:34,372
My friend, said he, I see that you are going to be a great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so young.

152
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:44,044
This can have been none other of those who dwell in heaven than Job's redoubtable daughter, the Tritoborn, who shewed such favor towards your brave father among the Argives.

153
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:51,394
Holy Queen, he continued, vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself, my good wife, and my children.

154
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:59,564
In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken and never yet brought by man under the yoke.

155
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:03,970
I will gild her horns and will offer her up to you in sacrifice."

156
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,493
Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer.

157
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:10,758
He then led the way to his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law.

158
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:20,470
When they had got there and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it.

159
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:26,283
As he mixed the wine, he prayed much and made drink offerings to Minerva, daughter of Aegis bearing Jove.

160
00:18:26,683 --> 00:18:32,856
Then, when they had made their drink offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home to bed each in his own abode.

161
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:40,872
But Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room that was over the gateway, along with Peisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now left him.

162
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:45,299
As for himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.

163
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:54,454
Now when the child of morning rosy-fingered dawn appeared, Nestor left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble that stood in front of his house.

164
00:18:55,175 --> 00:19:06,032
Here aforetime sat Nellius, peer of gods and counsel, but he was now dead and had gone to the house of Hades, so Nestor sat in his seat-sceptre in hand, as guardian of the public wheel.

165
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,595
His sons, as they left their rooms, gathered round him.

166
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:12,780
Echefron, Stratius, Perseus, Eretus, and Thrasymedes.

167
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,525
The sixth son was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with them.

168
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:19,167
Nestor then addressed them.

169
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:22,992
My sons, said he, make haste to do as I shall bid you.

170
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:30,400
I wish first and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, who manifested herself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities.

171
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:36,526
Go then, one or other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer, and come on here with it at once.

172
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:42,652
Another must go to Telemachus's ship, and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel.

173
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:47,636
Someone else will run and fetch Lercius the goldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer.

174
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:55,844
The rest, stay all of you where you are, tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to fetch seats and logs of wood for a burnt offering.

175
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:59,087
Tell them also to bring me some clear spring water,

176
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,350
On this they hurried off on their several errands.

177
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:05,957
The heifer was brought in from the plain, and Telemachus' crew came from the ship.

178
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:13,388
The goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his gold, and Minerva herself came to accept the sacrifice.

179
00:20:14,068 --> 00:20:19,156
Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty.

180
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:23,522
Then Stratius and Echefron brought her in by the horns.

181
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:30,700
Aretas fetched water from the house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand he held a basket of barley meal.

182
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:37,697
Sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket.

183
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:45,752
Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from the heifer's head upon the fire.

184
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:56,310
When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal 3.32, Thrasymedes dealt his blow and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut through the tendons at the base of her neck.

185
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:03,890
whereon the daughters and daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice, she was eldest daughter to Clymenus, screamed with delight.

186
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:08,642
Then they lifted the heifer's head from off the ground, and Pisistratus cut her throat.

187
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:12,612
When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up.

188
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:19,221
They cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them.

189
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:26,371
Then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five pronged spits in their hands.

190
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:34,582
When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire.

191
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:39,949
Meanwhile, lovely Polycast, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed Telemachus.

192
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:50,087
When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought him a fair mantle and shirt, 1033, and he looked like a god as he came from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor.

193
00:21:50,788 --> 00:22:00,165
When the outer meats were done, they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them out their wine in cups of gold.

194
00:22:00,145 --> 00:22:07,801
As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor said, Sons, put Telemachus' horses to the chariot, that he may start at once.

195
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:13,654
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked the fleet-horses to the chariot.

196
00:22:14,556 --> 00:22:20,128
The housekeeper packed them up a provision of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of princes.

197
00:22:20,108 --> 00:22:25,553
Then Telemachus got into the chariot, while Peisistratus gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him.

198
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:32,801
He lashed the horses on and they flew forward, nothing loth into the open country, leaving the high citadel of Pylos behind them.

199
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:39,788
All that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land.

200
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:46,875
Then they reached Pharai where Diocles lived, who was son to Ortolocus and grandson to Alpheus.

201
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:50,632
Here they passed the night, and Diocles entertained them hospitably.

202
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:58,250
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse.

203
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:03,041
Thirty-four Peisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forward, nothing loth.

204
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:10,278
Presently they came to the cornlands of the open country, and in the course of time completed their journey, so well did their steeds take them.

205
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:15,310
Thirty-five Now when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,
