Chapter 107 - The Carpenter.

3
00:00:03,217 --> 00:00:11,411
Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high-abstracted man alone, and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe.

4
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:22,090
But, from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:32,402
But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of the high humane abstraction, the Pequod's carpenter was no duplicate, hence he now comes in person on this stage.

6
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:46,339
Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed practical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings.

7
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:56,428
Collateral to his own, the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material.

8
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:14,925
But, besides the application to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four years voyage in uncivilized and far distant seas.

9
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:39,141
For not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties—repairing stoveboats, sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy bladed oars, inserting bullseyes in the deck, or new tree nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business—he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.

10
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:52,675
The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold was his vice-bench, a long, rude, ponderous table furnished with several vices of different sizes and both of iron and of wood.

11
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:59,859
At all times, except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed to thwart ships against the rear of the triworks.

12
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:04,488
A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole.

13
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:10,680
The carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices and straightway files it smaller.

14
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:21,557
A lost land bird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a captive out of clean-shaved rods of right whale bone and crossbeams of sperm whale ivory.

15
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:24,341
The carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it.

16
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:27,025
An oarsman sprains his wrist.

17
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:30,070
The carpenter concocts a soothing lotion.

18
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:37,822
Stubb longed for vermilion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar, screwing each oar in his big vice of wood.

19
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:41,067
The carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation.

20
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:44,412
A sailor takes a fancy to wear sharkbone earrings.

21
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:46,675
The carpenter drills his ears.

22
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:48,037
Another has the toothache.

23
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:53,326
The carpenter outpincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there.

24
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:58,174
But the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation.

25
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:03,803
Whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that,

26
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,387
if he would have him draw the tooth.

27
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,944
Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and without respect in all.

28
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:19,885
Teeth he accounted bits of ivory, heads he deemed but top blocks, men themselves he lightly held for capstans.

29
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:31,164
But while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too, all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence.

30
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:32,487
But not precisely so.

31
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:39,038
For nothing was this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity, as it were.

32
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:58,181
impersonal, I say, for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world, which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals.

33
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:06,190
Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness,

34
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:21,379
Yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness, such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah's Ark?

35
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:34,219
Was it that this old carpenter had been a lifelong wanderer, whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss, but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him?

36
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:43,689
He was a stripped abstract, an unfractioned integral, uncompromised as a newborn babe, living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.

37
00:04:44,390 --> 00:05:01,793
You might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence, for in his numerous trades he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to it, or by any inner mixture of all these, even or uneven,

38
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:06,062
but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process.

39
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:07,845
He was a pure manipulator.

40
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:13,537
His brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers.

41
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,246
He was like one of those unreasoning, but still highly useful, Meltem.

42
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:35,424
In P. Arvo, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior, though a little swelled, of a common pocket knife, but containing not only blades of various sizes, but also screwdrivers, corkscrews, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail filers, countersinkers.

43
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:43,896
So, if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screwdriver, all they had to do was to open that part of him and the screw was fast.

44
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:47,482
Or, if for tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.

45
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:55,576
Yet, as previously hinted, this omni-tooled, open-and-shut carpenter was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton.

46
00:05:56,177 --> 00:06:02,728
If he did not have a common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty.

47
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:08,142
What that was, whether essence of quicksilver or a few drops of harchorn, there is no telling.

48
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:12,894
But there it was, and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more.

49
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:18,709
And this it was, this same unaccountable cunning life-principle in him.

50
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:27,506
This it was that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing, but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes.

51
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:36,343
Or rather, his body was a sentry box, and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake.
