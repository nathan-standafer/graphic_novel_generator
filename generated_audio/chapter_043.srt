00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:01,840
Chapter 43 - Hark!

2
00:00:02,241 --> 00:00:02,621
Hissed!

3
00:00:03,163 --> 00:00:04,846
Did you hear that noise, Cabico?

4
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:07,891
It was the middle watch, a fair moonlight.

5
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:15,205
The seamen were standing in a cordon extending from one of the freshwater butts in the waist to the scuttlebutt near the tafrail.

6
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:18,910
In this manner they passed the buckets to fill the scuttlebutt.

7
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:25,759
Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarterdeck, they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:36,973
From hand to hand the buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of the sail and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.

9
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:46,558
It was in the midst of this repose that Archie, one of the cordon whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, Acholo, the words above.

10
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:48,404
Hissed.

11
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:49,886
Did you hear that noise, Kabako?

12
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:52,028
Take the bucket, will you, Arki?

13
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:53,430
What noise'd I mean?

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,151
There it is again.

15
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,433
Under the hatches.

16
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:57,374
Don't you hear it?

17
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:58,455
A cough.

18
00:00:58,795 --> 00:00:59,837
It sounded like a cough.

19
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:00,978
Cough.

20
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:01,839
Be damned.

21
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:03,801
Pass along that return bucket.

22
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:04,902
There again.

23
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:06,143
There it is.

24
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:08,927
It sounds like two or three sleepers turning over.

25
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:10,268
Now.

26
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:10,909
Caramba!

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,612
Have done, shipmate, will ye?

28
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:17,079
It's the three soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over in sight of ye.

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,321
Nothing else.

30
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:19,683
Look to the bucket.

31
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:21,626
Say what ye will, shipmate.

32
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:22,788
I've sharp ears.

33
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:31,041
Ay, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old Quakeress's knitting needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket, you're the chap.

34
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,608
Grin away, we'll see what turns up.

35
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:42,133
Hark ye, Cavico, there is somebody down in the afterhold that has not yet been seen on deck, and I suspect our old mogul knows something of it too.

36
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:47,729
I heard Stubb tell Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the wind.

37
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,755
Tish, the bucket.
