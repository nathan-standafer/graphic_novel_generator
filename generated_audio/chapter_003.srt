Chapter 3 The Spouter Inn

2
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:14,984
Entering that dable-ended spouter inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.

3
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:32,991
On one side hung a very large oil painting, so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study, in a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors,

4
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:37,279
that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose.

5
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:51,283
Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New England Hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched.

6
00:00:51,263 --> 00:01:09,540
But by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft-repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.

7
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:18,908
But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture,

8
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:30,434
over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast, a boggy, soggy, squitchy picture, truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.

9
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:38,432
Yet was there a sort of indefinite half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it,

10
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:44,720
till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant.

11
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:50,667
Ever in and on a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.

12
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:53,431
It's the black sea in a midnight gale.

13
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:57,436
It's the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.

14
00:01:57,997 --> 00:01:59,358
It's a blasted heath.

15
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,761
It's a hyperborean winter scene.

16
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,466
It's the breaking up of the ice-bound stream of time.

17
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:10,912
But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture's midst.

18
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:14,655
That one's found out, and all the rest were plain.

19
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:22,023
But stop there a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish, even the great Leviathan himself.

20
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:34,896
In fact, the artist's design seemed this covinal theory of my own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject.

21
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:38,020
The picture represents a Cape Horner in a great hurricane.

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:55,301
The half-founded ship, waltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible, and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast heads.

23
00:02:55,541 --> 00:03:02,790
The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears.

24
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:19,748
Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws, others were tufted with knots of human hair, and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower.

25
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:29,959
You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a-death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement.

26
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:36,047
Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons, all broken and deformed.

27
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:38,291
Some were storied weapons.

28
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:47,703
With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset.

29
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:58,258
And that harpoon-sow, like a corkscrew, now was flung in jauvincies, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco.

30
00:03:58,357 --> 00:04:23,535
The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found embedded in the hump, crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched wicket, through what in old times must have been a great central chimney, with fireplaces all round you, into the public room.

31
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:25,798
A still duskier place is this.

32
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:41,877
with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.

33
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:53,170
On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks,

34
00:04:53,150 --> 00:05:00,564
Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking Den Vibaro rude attempt at a right whale's head.

35
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:09,862
Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it.

36
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:14,230
Within are shabby shelves, range drowned with old decanters.

37
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:29,587
bottles, flasks, and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah by which name indeed they called him, bustles a little-withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors' deliriums and death.

38
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:41,820
Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison, though true cylinders without within, the villainous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.

39
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:48,752
Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads' goblets.

40
00:05:49,473 --> 00:06:00,955
Fill to this mark, and your charge is but a penny to this, a penny more, and so on to the full glass for Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.

41
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:05,884
Upon entering the place, I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table,

42
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:21,477
Examining by a dim light diver's specimens of scrimshander, I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was full not a bed unoccupied.

43
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:24,723
"'But avast,' he added, tapping his forehead.

44
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:29,612
"'You hain't no objections to sharing a harpooner's blanket, have ye?'

45
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:32,216
"'I spose you're gonna wheelin.'

46
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:38,187
"'So you'd better get used to that sort of thing,' I told him that I never liked to sleep to in a bed.

47
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,832
"'That if I should ever do soâ€”'

48
00:06:40,812 --> 00:07:02,888
It would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why, rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any decent man's blanket.

49
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:03,689
I thought so.

50
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:05,593
All right, take a seat.

51
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:06,434
Supper?

52
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:07,737
You want supper?

53
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:10,081
Supper'll be ready directly."

54
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:15,570
I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the battery.

55
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:26,850
At one end, a ruminating tower was still further adorning it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs.

56
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:32,560
He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.

57
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,428
At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room.

58
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:44,080
It was cold, as Iceland no fire at all the landlord said he couldn't afford it.

59
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,528
Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet.

60
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:56,183
We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half-frozen fingers.

61
00:07:57,225 --> 00:08:02,855
But the fare was of the most substantial kind, not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings.

62
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:04,218
God heavens!

63
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:06,422
Dumplings for supper!

64
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:12,892
One young fellow in a green-box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.

65
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:19,222
"'My boy,' said the landlord, "'you'll have the nightmare to a dead Sartenti.'"

66
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:23,068
"'Landlord,' I whispered, "'that ain't the harpooner, is it?'

67
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:27,955
"'Oh, no,' said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny.

68
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:30,240
The Harponier is a dark complexion, chap.

69
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,384
He never eats dumplings, he don't.

70
00:08:32,906 --> 00:08:34,329
He eats nothing but steaks.

71
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,992
And he likes M.

72
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:36,313
Rare."

73
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:40,762
"'The devil he does,' says I. Where is that Harponier?

74
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:41,865
Is he here?'

75
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:45,893
"'He'll be here afore long,' was the answer.

76
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:51,359
I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this dark, complexioned harponeer.

77
00:08:52,260 --> 00:09:00,469
At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed before I did.

78
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:10,800
Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker-on.

79
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:14,985
Presently a rioting noise was heard without.

80
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:24,592
"'Starting up,' the Landlord cried, "'that's the Grampuses' crew,' Iceda reported in the Offen this morning, a three years' voyage, and a full ship.

81
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:29,346
Hurrah, boys, now I'll have the latest news from the Feegees."

82
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,723
A tramping of sea-boots was heard in the entry.

83
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:37,929
The door was flung open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.

84
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:52,245
Enveloped in their shaggy watch-coats, and with their heads muffled in woolen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.

85
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:56,946
They had just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they entered.

86
00:09:57,908 --> 00:10:10,352
No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the whale's mouth, the bar, when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.

87
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:31,699
Juan complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and cataracts whatsoever, never mind of how long-standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador or on the weather-side of an ice-island.

88
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:43,873
The liquor soon mounted into their hands, as it generally does even with the Orantis toppers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about most obstreperously.

89
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:55,746
I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face,

90
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:59,892
Yet, upon the whole, he refrained from making as much noise as the rest.

91
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:16,217
This man interested me at once, and, since the sea gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate, though but a sleeping partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned, I will here venture upon a little description of him.

92
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:23,168
He stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a cofferdam.

93
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:25,473
I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.

94
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:38,300
His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast, while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.

95
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,709
His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner.

96
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:51,237
And from his fine stature I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghenian Ridge in Virginia.

97
00:11:51,317 --> 00:12:02,367
When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.

98
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:12,696
In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favorite with them, they raised a cry of,

99
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:13,897
Bolking!

100
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:15,900
Where's Bolkington?"

101
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,883
and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.

102
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:33,139
It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seaman.

103
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,063
No man prefers to sleep two in a bed

104
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:42,090
In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother.

105
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:47,961
I don't know how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping.

106
00:12:48,161 --> 00:13:00,283
And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooner, then your objections indefinitely multiply.

107
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:13,166
Nor was there any earthly reason Why I, as a sailor, should sleep to in a bed More than anybody else, for sailors no more Sleep to in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore.

108
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:22,963
To be sure, they all sleep together in one apartment, But you have your own hammock, and cover yourself With your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.

109
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:30,654
The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him.

110
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:41,475
It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woolen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.

111
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,499
I began to twitch all over.

112
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:49,993
Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards.

113
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:53,301
Suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight.

114
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:59,093
How could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?

115
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:02,009
I've changed my mind about that Harponier.

116
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,111
I shan't sleep with him.

117
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:05,813
I'll try the bench here.

118
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,014
Just as you please.

119
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:11,078
I'm sorry I can't spare you a tablecloth for a mattress.

120
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:15,923
And it's a plaguey rough board here, feeling of the knots and notches.

121
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,386
But wait a bit, Scrimshanda.

122
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:24,372
I have got a carpenter's playing there in the barred wade, I say, and I'll make you snug enough.

123
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:35,262
So saying, he procured the plane, and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, a while grinning like an ape.

124
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:43,558
The shavings flew right and left, till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.

125
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:58,602
The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him, for heaven's sake, to quit the bed, was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make either down of a pine plank.

126
00:14:58,622 --> 00:15:09,259
So, gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study.

127
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:18,594
I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short, but that could be mended with a chair.

128
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:29,273
But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one, so there was no yoking them.

129
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:39,796
I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.

130
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:47,312
But I soon found that there came such a draft of cold air over me from under the sill of the window

131
00:15:47,292 --> 00:16:05,183
that this plan would never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.

132
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:08,968
The devil fetched that harpooner, thought I. But stop!

133
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:16,978
Couldn't I steal a march on him, bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be awakened by the most violent knockings?

134
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,622
It seemed no bad idea.

135
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:27,632
But upon second thoughts I dismissed it, for who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room?

136
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:31,677
The harpooner might be standing in the entry.

137
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,500
all ready to knock me down.

138
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:51,589
Still looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer, thinks I,

139
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:52,973
I'll wait a while.

140
00:16:53,153 --> 00:16:55,019
He must be dropping in before long.

141
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:01,497
I'll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all.

142
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:03,081
There's no telling.

143
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:10,774
But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.

144
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:15,119
"'Landlord,' said I, was sort of a chap as he dance.

145
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,001
He always keeps such late hours."

146
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:20,125
It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.

147
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:27,533
The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.

148
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,577
"'No,' he answered.

149
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:34,866
'Generally he's an early bird, early to bed and early to rise, yes.

150
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,511
He's the bird what catches the worm.

151
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:47,749
But to-night he went out to paddling, you see, and I don't see what on air keeps him so late, unless maybe he can't sell his head.'

152
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:49,311
can't sell his head.

153
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:53,478
What sort of a bamboozlingly story is this you are telling me?"

154
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:07,980
Getting into a towering rage, "'Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooner is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?'

155
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,766
"'That's precisely it,' said the landlord.

156
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:16,032
And I told him he couldn't sell it here, the markets overstocked.

157
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:16,873
"'With what?'

158
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:17,895
shouted I.

159
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:20,038
"'With heads, to be sure.

160
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,522
Ain't there too many heads in the world?'

161
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:27,049
"'I tell you what it is, landlord,' said I quite calmly.

162
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:29,713
"'You'd better stop spinning that yarn to me.

163
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:30,835
I'm not green.'

164
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:34,581
"'Maybe not,' taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick.

165
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:42,373
"'But I rather guess you'll be done brown, if that here Harponier hears you a-slundering his head.'

166
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:50,461
break it for him," said I, now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.

167
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:52,324
"'It's broker eighty,' said he.

168
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,787
"'Broke,' said I. Broke.

169
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:55,889
"'Do you mean?'

170
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:57,211
"'Certain.

171
00:18:57,251 --> 00:19:00,075
And that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess.'

172
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:06,925
"'Landlord,' said I, going up to him as cool as Mettecla in a snowstorm, landlord, stop whittling.

173
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:12,073
You and I must understand one another, and that too without delay.

174
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:14,568
I come to your house and want a bed.

175
00:19:15,272 --> 00:19:18,672
You tell me you can only give me half a one, thatâ€”

176
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:21,511
The other half belongs to a certain Harponier.

177
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:44,119
And about this Harponier, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories, tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you designed for my bedfellow a sort of connection, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree."

178
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:54,471
I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respect safe to spend the night with him.

179
00:19:54,972 --> 00:20:14,055
And, in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which, if true, I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I have no idea of sleeping with a madman and you, sirâ€”you mean, landlord, you, sir?

180
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:21,181
by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution."

181
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:21,622
"'What?'

182
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:24,524
said the landlord, fetching a long breath.

183
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:29,529
"'That's a pretty long sermon for a chap that rips a little now and then.

184
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:31,490
But be easy, be easy.

185
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:43,401
This here harponeer I have been telling you of has just arrived from the South Seas, where he bought up a lot of bombed New Zealand heads, great curios, you know.

186
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:57,274
and he's sold all on him but one, and that one he's trying to sell tonight, cos tomorrow's Sunday, and it would not do to be selling human heads about the streets when folks is going to churches."

187
00:20:57,814 --> 00:21:09,024
He wanted to last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was going out of the door, with four heads strung on a string, for all the earth like a string of Indians.

188
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:13,388
This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery,

189
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:31,934
and showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me but, at the same time, what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night, clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolaters?

190
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:37,401
Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.

191
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:40,044
"'He pays reglaw,' was the rejoinder.

192
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:43,347
"'But come, it's getting dreadful late.

193
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,369
You had better be turning flukes.

194
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,134
It's a nice bed Sal and me slept in that air-bed the night we were spliced.

195
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:53,858
There's plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed.

196
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,421
It's an almighty big bed, that.

197
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:03,068
Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it.

198
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:11,117
But I got a-dreaming and scrawling about one night, and somehow Sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm.

199
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:14,461
Harder that, Sam said it wouldn't do.

200
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:15,282
Come along here.

201
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:17,605
I'll give you a glim and a jiffy.

202
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:23,852
And so saying, he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.

203
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:28,617
But I stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner, he explained.

204
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,361
Ah, vomit Sunday, you won't see that Harponier to-night.

205
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:34,724
He's come to anchor somewhere.

206
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:35,965
Come along, then.

207
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,927
You come, dey come."

208
00:22:38,548 --> 00:22:54,165
I considered the matter a moment, and then upstairs we went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four Harponiers to sleep abreast.

209
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:55,215
There!"

210
00:22:55,797 --> 00:23:07,193
said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea-chest that did double duty as a washstand and scented table.

211
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:12,221
I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.

212
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:15,586
Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.

213
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:21,314
Though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.

214
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:36,437
I then glanced round the room, and, besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale.

215
00:23:36,637 --> 00:23:51,837
Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner, also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooner's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.

216
00:23:51,857 --> 00:24:01,910
Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish-hooks on the shelf over the fireplace, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.

217
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,193
But what is this on the chest?

218
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:05,395
I took it up.

219
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:15,247
and held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.

220
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:27,501
I can compare it to nothing but a large doormat, ornamented at the edges with little, tinkling tags, something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.

221
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:34,164
There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.

222
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:43,938
But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a doormat and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?

223
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,042
Put it on to try it.

224
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:58,314
and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.

225
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:05,022
I went up in it, to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life.

226
00:25:06,063 --> 00:25:10,988
I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.

227
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:19,099
I sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooner and his doormat.

228
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:28,653
After thinking some time on the bedside, I got up and took off my monkey-jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking.

229
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:33,820
I then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt-sleeves.

230
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:57,657
But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneers not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light, tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of Heaven.

231
00:25:57,837 --> 00:26:02,524
Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn cobs, or broken crockery,

232
00:26:02,504 --> 00:26:08,571
There is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time.

233
00:26:09,212 --> 00:26:23,669
At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nob, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.

234
00:26:23,689 --> 00:26:30,857
"'Lord, save me,' thinks I. That must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-pebbler.

235
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:35,042
But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to.

236
00:26:35,082 --> 00:26:55,765
Holding a light in one hand, and that identical Gruzeland head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of,

237
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:57,387
as being in the room.

238
00:26:57,607 --> 00:27:04,895
I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.

239
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,901
This accomplished, however, he turned round when, good heavens!

240
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:11,062
what a sight!

241
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:12,264
such a face!

242
00:27:12,824 --> 00:27:19,812
It was of a dark purplish-yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish-looking squares.

243
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:22,243
Yes, it's just as I thought.

244
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:24,225
He's a terrible bedfellow.

245
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:29,670
I's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.

246
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:41,481
But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that I plainly saw they could not be sticking plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks.

247
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:44,724
They were stains of some sort or other.

248
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:47,487
At first I knew not what to make of this.

249
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:50,611
But soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me.

250
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:59,163
I remembered a story of a white man, a whaleman to who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them.

251
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:06,893
I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.

252
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:09,176
And what is it, thought I, after all?

253
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:14,481
It's only his outside of, ah, ma, can be honest in any sort of skin.

254
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:17,985
But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion?

255
00:28:18,686 --> 00:28:29,498
That part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing, to be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning.

256
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:35,665
But I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish-yellow one.

257
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:44,863
However, I had never been in the South Seas, and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.

258
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:52,523
Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this Harponia never noticed me at all.

259
00:28:52,503 --> 00:29:04,122
But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a seal-skin wallet with a hair on.

260
00:29:04,282 --> 00:29:15,000
Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head, a ghastly thing enough, and crammed it down into the bag.

261
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,986
He now took off his hat, a new beaver hat, when I came nigh, singing and with fresh surprise.

262
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:29,174
There was no hair on his head, none to speak of, at least nothing, but a small scout-knot twisted up on his forehead.

263
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:35,199
His bald, purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.

264
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:43,367
Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.

265
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:50,657
Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the second floor back.

266
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:58,433
I am no coward but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether past my comprehension.

267
00:29:58,593 --> 00:30:13,422
Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room

268
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:14,605
at the dead of night.

269
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:26,078
In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.

270
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:32,613
Meanwhile he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his chest and arms.

271
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:41,941
As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face, his back, too, was all over the same dark squares.

272
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:49,708
He seemed to have been in a thirty years' war, and just escaped from it with a sticking plaster shirt.

273
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:57,415
Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.

274
00:30:57,395 --> 00:31:08,565
It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country.

275
00:31:09,306 --> 00:31:14,330
I quaked to think of it, a peddler of heads to perhaps the heads of his own brothers.

276
00:31:15,211 --> 00:31:17,873
He might take a fancy to mine heavens!

277
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,915
Look at that tomahawk!

278
00:31:19,935 --> 00:31:27,402
But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention.

279
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:35,594
and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen, going to his heavy greggle, or rappel, or dreadnought.

280
00:31:35,614 --> 00:31:44,947
Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black mannequin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner.

281
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:51,516
But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony,

282
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:57,849
I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which, indeed, it proved to be.

283
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:09,792
For now the savage goes up to the empty fireplace, and, removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunchbacked image, like a tin-pin, between the andirons.

284
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:21,172
The chimney-jams and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.

285
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,979
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half-hidden image.

286
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:29,604
Feeling but ill at ease mean time to see what was next to follow.

287
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:47,305
First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his gregal pocket and places them carefully before the idol, then laying a bit of shit-biscuit on top, and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze.

288
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:59,061
Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers, whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly, he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit.

289
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:05,850
Then, blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.

290
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:12,615
end of But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all.

291
00:33:13,276 --> 00:33:14,759
He never moved his lips.

292
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:34,791
All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song, or else singing some pagan psalmity or other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner, at last extinguishing the fire.

293
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:45,165
He took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grigo pocket, as carelessly as if he were a sportsman begging a dead woodcock.

294
00:33:45,426 --> 00:34:03,090
All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was put out.

295
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,459
to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.

296
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:11,774
But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one.

297
00:34:12,577 --> 00:34:18,092
Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant,

298
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:25,472
and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.

299
00:34:25,492 --> 00:34:33,313
The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.

300
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:43,987
I sang out, I could not help it now, and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me, stammering out something I knew not what.

301
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:55,058
I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.

302
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:01,765
But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning,

303
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:05,651
"'Oui, W. He at last said you no speaky.

304
00:35:05,752 --> 00:35:06,974
Damn me, I killy!'

305
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:11,701
And so saying, the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.

306
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:15,007
"'Landlord, for God's sake, peel coffin!'

307
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:18,132
shouted I. Landlord, watch, coffin!

308
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:20,175
Angels, save me!'

309
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:24,596
Speak ye, tell me who he be, or damn me I kill ye."

310
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:33,668
Again growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my minon would get on fire.

311
00:35:33,688 --> 00:35:37,974
But thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand.

312
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:40,678
In leaping from the bed I ran up to him.

313
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,291
"'Don't be afraid now,' said he, grinning again.

314
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:48,956
"'Quick-quake here wouldn't harm a hair of your head.'

315
00:35:48,976 --> 00:35:51,619
"'Stop your grinning,' shouted I.

316
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:56,125
"'And why didn't you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?'

317
00:35:56,145 --> 00:35:58,408
"'I thought ye noted it.

318
00:35:58,869 --> 00:35:59,790
Didn't I tell ye?

319
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,234
He was a-peddling heads around town.

320
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:05,558
But turn flukes again and go to sleep.'

321
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:06,239
"'Quick-quake!

322
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:08,021
Look here, you sabby me.

323
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:09,603
I'll sabby you, this man.

324
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:11,526
Sleep you, you sabby.'

325
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:17,513
Me sabby plendy," grunted Cuicague, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.

326
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:24,302
"'You get he in,' he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side.

327
00:36:24,322 --> 00:36:29,168
"'He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way.

328
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,591
I stood looking at him a moment.

329
00:36:32,312 --> 00:36:37,598
For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely-looking cannibal.

330
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:40,341
What's all this fuss I have been making about?"

331
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:41,963
thought I, to myself.

332
00:36:42,623 --> 00:36:45,306
The man's a human being, just as I am Kur.

333
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:50,111
He has just as much reason to fear me as I have to be afraid of him.

334
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:54,015
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.

335
00:36:54,035 --> 00:37:00,982
"'Landlord,' said I, "'tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it.

336
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:05,307
Tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him.'

337
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:08,716
But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me.

338
00:37:09,177 --> 00:37:09,919
It's dangerous.

339
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:12,646
Besides, I ain't insured."

340
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:23,134
This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed, rolling over to one side, as much as to say, "'I won't touch a leg of ye.'"

341
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:27,264
"'Good-night, landlord,' said I. You may go."

342
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:31,395
I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
