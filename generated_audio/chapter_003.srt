00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,981
Chapter 3 - The Spouter Inn

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:04,651
Entering that gable-ended spouter inn, 

3
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:14,234
you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.

4
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:30,190
On one side hung a very large oil painting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors,

5
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,376
that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose.

6
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:45,478
Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched.

7
00:00:46,015 --> 00:01:01,037
but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft-repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.

8
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:13,744
But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the center of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast.

9
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:19,195
A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture, truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.

10
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:31,320
Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvelous painting meant?

11
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:36,528
Ever and anon, a bright but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.

12
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:39,693
It's the black sea in a midnight gale.

13
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:43,900
It's the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.

14
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:45,029
It's a blasted heath.

15
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,713
It's a hyperborean winter scene.

16
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:51,179
It's the breaking up of the icebound stream of time.

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,931
But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture's midst.

18
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,876
That once found out, and all the rest were plain.

19
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:02,069
But stop!

20
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,777
Does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish?

21
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,081
Even the great Leviathan himself?

22
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:19,945
In fact, the artist's design seemed this, a final theory of my own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject.

23
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:37,444
The picture represents a Cape Horner in a great hurricane, the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible, and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mastheads.

24
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:43,115
The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears.

25
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:57,964
Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws, others were tufted with knots of human hair, and one was sickle-shaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new mown grass by a long-armed mower.

26
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:06,392
You shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone adef, harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement.

27
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:12,958
Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed, all broken and deformed.

28
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,840
Some were storied weapons.

29
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:24,289
With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset.

30
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:32,780
And that harpoon, so like a corkscrew now, was flung in Javan's seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards, slain off the Cape of Blanco.

31
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:45,096
The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found embedded in the hump.

32
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:56,069
crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low-arched way, cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round, you enter the public room.

33
00:03:56,089 --> 00:04:13,108
A still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.

34
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:22,048
On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks.

35
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:30,186
Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den, the bar, a rude attempt at a right whale's head.

36
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:38,283
Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it.

37
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:56,221
Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks, and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah, by which name indeed they called him, bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailor's deliriums and death.

38
00:04:57,202 --> 00:05:00,325
Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.

39
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:08,272
Though true cylinders without, within, the villainous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.

40
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:14,262
Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads' goblets.

41
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:19,931
Fill to this mark, and your charge is but a penny, to this a penny more, and so on to the full glass.

42
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:23,697
The cape-horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.

43
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:31,659
Upon entering the place, I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table, examining by a dim light diver specimens of scrimshander.

44
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,872
I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was full, not a bed unoccupied.

45
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,277
But a vast, he added, tapping his forehead.

46
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:47,942
You hain't no objections to sharing a harponeer's blanket, have ye?

47
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:52,789
I suppose you are going a-whaling, so you'd better get used to that sort of thing.

48
00:05:52,955 --> 00:06:14,481
I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed, that if I should ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he, the landlord, really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any decent man's blanket.

49
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:15,902
I thought so.

50
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,945
All right, take a seat.

51
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:18,786
Supper?

52
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:20,027
You want supper?

53
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,270
Supper will be ready directly.

54
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:26,722
I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the battery.

55
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:34,956
At one end the ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jackknife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs.

56
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:40,545
He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.

57
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,310
At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room.

58
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,534
It was cold as Iceland, no fire at all.

59
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:49,737
The landlord said he couldn't afford it.

60
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:54,103
Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet.

61
00:06:54,924 --> 00:07:01,052
We were feigned to button up our monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half-frozen fingers.

62
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:03,836
But the fare was of the most substantial kind.

63
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,620
Not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings.

64
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,521
Good heavens!

65
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:09,283
Dumplings for supper!

66
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:15,191
One young fellow in a green boxcoat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.

67
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:20,037
My boy, said the landlord, you'll have the nightmare to a dead certainty.

68
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,602
Landlord, I whispered, that ain't the Harponeer, is it?

69
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:30,512
Oh no, said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, the Harponeer is a dark-complexioned chap.

70
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,914
He never eats dumplings, he don't.

71
00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:34,557
He eats nothing but steaks, and he likes them rare.

72
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:38,683
The devil he does, says I. Where is that harpooner?

73
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:39,384
Is he here?

74
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:42,207
He'll be here afore long, was the answer.

75
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:47,154
I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this dark-complexioned harpooner.

76
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:55,605
At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed before I did.

77
00:07:55,703 --> 00:08:03,743
Supper over, the company went back to the barroom, when, knowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker-on.

78
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:07,131
Presently, a rioting noise was heard without.

79
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:10,882
Starting up, the landlord cried, that's the grampus's crew.

80
00:08:10,902 --> 00:08:16,212
I seed her reported in the offing this morning, a three years voyage and a full ship.

81
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:20,420
Hurrah boys, now we'll have the latest news from the Fijis.

82
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:23,726
A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry.

83
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:28,495
The door was flung open and enrolled a wild set of mariners enough.

84
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:40,193
Enveloped in their shaggy watchcoats, and with their heads muffled in woolen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.

85
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:44,880
They had just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they entered.

86
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:54,664
No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the whale's mouth, the bar, when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.

87
00:08:55,285 --> 00:09:13,348
One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catars whatsoever, never mind of how long-standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather-side of an ice island.

88
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:23,322
The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with the errantest toppers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about most obstreperously.

89
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:35,537
I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest.

90
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:48,313
This man interested me at once, and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate, though but a sleeping partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned, I will here venture upon a little description of him.

91
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:53,106
He stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a cofferdam.

92
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,769
I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.

93
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:07,005
His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast, while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.

94
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:16,258
His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghenian Ridge in Virginia.

95
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:25,725
When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.

96
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:34,316
In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favorite with them, they raised a cry of, Bulkington!

97
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:35,558
Bulkington!

98
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:36,980
Where's Bulkington?

99
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,384
and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.

100
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:52,506
It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seaman.

101
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,210
No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.

102
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,297
In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother.

103
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:03,083
I don't know how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping.

104
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:11,997
And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooner,

105
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:14,641
then your objections indefinitely multiply.

106
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:28,940
Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else, for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore, to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment.

107
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:34,968
But you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.

108
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:41,477
The more I pondered over this harpooner, the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him.

109
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:50,051
It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woolen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.

110
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:52,115
I began to twitch all over.

111
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:57,845
Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards.

112
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:01,491
Suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight.

113
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,317
How could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?

114
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:05,539
Landlord!

115
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,004
I've changed my mind about that harpooner.

116
00:12:08,465 --> 00:12:09,547
I shat sleep with him.

117
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,010
I'll try the bench here.

118
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:12,573
Just as you please.

119
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:20,188
I'm sorry I can't spare you a tablecloth for a mattress, and it's a plaguey rough board here, feeling of the knots and notches.

120
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:23,869
But wait a bit, Scrimshander, I've got a carpenter's plane there in the bar.

121
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,996
Wait, I say, and I'll make you snug enough."

122
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:37,131
So saying he procured the plane, and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the wile grinning like an ape.

123
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:42,864
The shavings flew right and left, till at last the plane iron came bump against an indestructible knot.

124
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:47,975
The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's sake to quit.

125
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:55,491
The bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make either down of a pine plank.

126
00:12:55,707 --> 00:13:04,698
So gathering up the shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business and left me in a brown study.

127
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:10,665
I now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short, but that could be mended with a chair.

128
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:18,694
But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one, so there was no yoking them.

129
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:27,045
I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.

130
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:45,070
But I soon found that there came such a draft of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.

131
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:48,952
The devil fetched that harpooneer, thought I. But stop!

132
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:50,656
Couldn't I steal a march on him?

133
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:56,551
Bolt his door inside and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?

134
00:13:57,514 --> 00:14:01,624
It seemed no bad idea, but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.

135
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:09,234
For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooner might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down.

136
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:24,108
Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night, unless in some other person's bed, I began to think that after all, I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooner.

137
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:28,692
Thinks I, I'll wait a while, he must be dropping in before long.

138
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:33,057
I'll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all."

139
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:34,679
There's no telling.

140
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:42,189
But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harponeer.

141
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,053
"'Landlord,' said I, "'what sort of a chap is he?

142
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,136
Does he always keep such late hours?'

143
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:51,180
It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.

144
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,088
The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.

145
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,807
No, he answered.

146
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:04,174
Generally he's an early bird, early to bed and early to rise.

147
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,638
Yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.

148
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:14,692
But tonight he went out a-peddling, you see, and I don't see what on earth keeps him so late, unless, maybe, he can't sell his head.

149
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:16,294
Can't sell his head?

150
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:19,840
What sort of a bamboozlingly story is this you are telling me?

151
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,725
Getting into a towering rage.

152
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:32,044
Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooner is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?"

153
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:37,094
That's precisely it," said the landlord, and I told him he couldn't sell it here.

154
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:38,497
The market's overstocked.

155
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:39,879
With what?"

156
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,284
shouted I. With heads, to be sure.

157
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,629
Ain't there too many heads in the world?

158
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:47,675
I tell you what it is, landlord," said I quite calmly.

159
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:49,861
You'd better stop spinning that yarn to me.

160
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:50,864
I'm not green.

161
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:59,749
Maybe not, taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, but I rather guess you'll be done brown if that heir harpoonier hears you a slander in his head.

162
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:05,550
I'll break it for him," said I, now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.

163
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:07,555
It's broke already, said he.

164
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:10,964
Broke, said I. Broke, do you mean?

165
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,375
Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess.

166
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:19,702
"'Landlord,' said I, going up to him as cool as Monhecla in a snowstorm.

167
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,605
"'Landlord, stop whittling.

168
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:25,271
You and I must understand one another, and that too without delay.

169
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,375
I come to your house and want a bed.

170
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:32,503
You tell me you can only give me half of one, that the other half belongs to a certain harponeer.'

171
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,125
that the other half belongs to a certain harpooner.

172
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:54,643
And about this harpooner, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow, a sort of connection, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree.

173
00:16:54,623 --> 00:17:02,895
I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooner is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him.

174
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:15,514
And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which, if true, I take to be good evidence that this harpooner is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping with a madman.

175
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:20,361
And you, sir, you, I mean, landlord, you, sir,

176
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:26,347
By trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution."

177
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:29,750
Wall," said the landlord, fetching a long breath.

178
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:33,234
That's a pretty long sermon for a chap that rips a little now and then.

179
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:35,736
But be easy, be easy.

180
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:47,428
This here harpooner I have been telling you of has just arrived from the South Seas, where he bought up a lot of balm New Zealand heads, great curios, you know, and he sold all on them but one.

181
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:56,099
And that one he's trying to sell tonight caused tomorrow's Sunday and it would not do to be selling human heads about the streets when folks is going to churches.

182
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:05,331
He wanted to last Sunday but I stopped him just as he was going out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the earth like a string of Indians.

183
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:13,922
This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling me.

184
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:24,735
But at the same time, what could I think of a harpooner who stayed out of a Saturday night, clean into the Holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolaters?

185
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:26,618
Depend upon it, landlord.

186
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,062
That harpooner is a dangerous man.

187
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:31,626
He pays regular, was the rejoinder.

188
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,250
But come, it's getting dreadful late.

189
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:35,873
You had better be turning flukes.

190
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:37,456
It's a nice bed.

191
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:40,821
Sal and me slept in that earbed the night we were spliced.

192
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:43,459
There's plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed.

193
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,482
It's an almighty big bed, that.

194
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:50,550
Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it.

195
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:58,542
But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow Sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm.

196
00:18:59,444 --> 00:19:01,527
Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.

197
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:04,583
Come along here, I'll give you a glim and a jiffy."

198
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:09,472
And so saying, he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.

199
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,295
But I stood irresolute.

200
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:15,744
When looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed, "'Ivum, it's Sunday.

201
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:17,728
You won't see that harpooner tonight.

202
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:19,050
He's come to anchor somewhere.

203
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,192
Come along then.

204
00:19:20,232 --> 00:19:20,974
Dio, come.

205
00:19:21,154 --> 00:19:22,637
Won't ye come?'

206
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:35,113
I considered the matter a moment, and then upstairs we went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.

207
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:46,768
There, said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea-chest that did double duty as a washstand and center table, there, make yourself comfortable now, and good-night-tea.

208
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:50,013
I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.

209
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:52,878
Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.

210
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:57,205
Though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.

211
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:09,988
I then glanced round the room, and besides, the bedstead and center table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale.

212
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:23,352
Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner, also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooner's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.

213
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:31,622
Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fishhooks on the shelf over the fireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.

214
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:33,530
But what is this on the chest?

215
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:43,583
I took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.

216
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:53,796
I can compare it to nothing but a large doormat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags, something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.

217
00:20:54,597 --> 00:21:00,124
There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.

218
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:07,896
But could it be possible that any sober harpooner would get into a doormat and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?

219
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:19,933
I put it on to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooner had been wearing it of a rainy day.

220
00:21:19,993 --> 00:21:26,061
I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life.

221
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,763
I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.

222
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:37,384
I sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooner and his doormat.

223
00:21:37,972 --> 00:21:44,498
After thinking some time on the bedside, I got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking.

224
00:21:45,118 --> 00:21:48,561
I then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.

225
00:21:49,242 --> 00:22:07,978
But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the harpeniers not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven.

226
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:16,852
Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time.

227
00:22:16,892 --> 00:22:29,431
At last I slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.

228
00:22:30,052 --> 00:22:35,400
Lord save me, thinks I. That must be the harpooner, the infernal head peddler.

229
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,387
But I lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to.

230
00:22:39,447 --> 00:22:58,198
Holding a light in one hand and that identical New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag-eye before spoke of as being in the room.

231
00:22:58,178 --> 00:23:05,007
I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.

232
00:23:05,707 --> 00:23:07,890
This accomplished, however, he turned round.

233
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:10,574
When, good heavens, what a sight!

234
00:23:11,214 --> 00:23:12,055
Such a face!

235
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:18,464
It was of a dark purplish-yellow color, here and there stuck over with large blackish-looking squares.

236
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,466
Yes, it's just as I thought.

237
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,228
He's a terrible bedfellow.

238
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:27,595
He's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.

239
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:33,333
But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that I plainly saw they could not be sticking.

240
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:36,938
Plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks.

241
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,602
They were stains of some sort or other.

242
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:44,469
At first I knew not what to make of this, but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me.

243
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:51,439
I remembered a story of a white man, a whaleman too, who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them.

244
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:57,927
I concluded that this harpooner, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.

245
00:23:57,947 --> 00:24:00,351
And what is it, thought I, after all?

246
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:02,556
It's only his outside.

247
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:05,361
A man can be honest in any sort of skin.

248
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:14,705
But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing?

249
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:18,829
To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning.

250
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,955
But I never heard of a hot sun's tanning, a white man into a purplish-yellow one.

251
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:31,703
However, I had never been in the South Seas, and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.

252
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:37,871
Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooner never noticed me at all.

253
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:48,204
But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hair on.

254
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:57,235
Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head, a ghastly thing enough, and crammed it down into the bag.

255
00:24:57,215 --> 00:25:02,741
He now took off his hat, a new beaver hat, when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.

256
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:09,368
There was no hair on his head, none to speak of at least, nothing but a small scalp knot twisted up on his forehead.

257
00:25:09,949 --> 00:25:13,994
His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.

258
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:18,619
Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever.

259
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:19,760
I bolted at dinner.

260
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:25,146
Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the second floor back.

261
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,857
I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.

262
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:43,354
Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.

263
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:53,108
In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.

264
00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:57,618
Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arms.

265
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:02,783
As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face.

266
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:06,287
His back, too, was all over the same dark squares.

267
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:11,293
He seemed to have been in a thirty years war and just escaped from it with a sticking plaster shirt.

268
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:19,922
Still more, his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.

269
00:26:19,902 --> 00:26:27,971
It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or others shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country.

270
00:26:28,812 --> 00:26:29,773
I quaked to think of it.

271
00:26:30,614 --> 00:26:31,755
A peddler of heads, too.

272
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:33,758
Perhaps the heads of his own brothers.

273
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:35,680
He might take a fancy to mine.

274
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:36,721
Heavens!

275
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,383
Look at that tomahawk.

276
00:26:39,024 --> 00:26:48,154
But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen.

277
00:26:48,202 --> 00:27:01,587
Going to his heavy grego or rapal or dreadnought, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back and exactly the color of a three days old Congo baby.

278
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:08,509
Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black mannequin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner.

279
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:18,998
But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be.

280
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:29,548
For now, the savage goes up to the empty fireplace, and removing the papered fireboard sets up this little hunchbacked image, like a ten-pin, between the andirons.

281
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:39,025
The chimney jams and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.

282
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:47,200
I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half-hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime, to see what was next to follow.

283
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:53,312
First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol.

284
00:27:53,914 --> 00:28:00,750
Then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze.

285
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:11,733
Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers, whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly, he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit.

286
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:17,423
Then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.

287
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:21,230
But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all.

288
00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:22,632
He never moved his lips.

289
00:28:23,454 --> 00:28:38,095
All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.

290
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:49,748
At last, extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.

291
00:28:50,409 --> 00:29:09,246
All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.

292
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:14,118
But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one.

293
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:24,484
Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.

294
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:31,580
The next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.

295
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:37,410
I sang out, I could not help it now, and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.

296
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:49,392
Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again.

297
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,408
But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill-comprehended my meaning.

298
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,750
Who?

299
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:58,295
Edebelu, he at last said.

300
00:29:58,335 --> 00:30:05,507
You no speaky, damn me, I kill ye, and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.

301
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:08,031
"'Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!'

302
00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:08,751
shouted I.

303
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:09,693
"'Landlord!

304
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,334
Watch!

305
00:30:10,614 --> 00:30:11,075
Coffin!

306
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:11,816
Angels!

307
00:30:12,096 --> 00:30:12,597
Save me!

308
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,418
Speak ye!

309
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,222
Tell ye me who ye be or damn me, I kill ye!'

310
00:30:16,562 --> 00:30:24,673
again growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.

311
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:31,663
But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.

312
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,465
Don't be afraid now, said he, grinning again.

313
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:37,389
Queak-white here wouldn't harm a hair of your head.

314
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:43,577
Stop your grinning, shouted I, and why didn't you tell me that that infernal harpooner was a cannibal?

315
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:47,943
I thought ye knowed it, didn't I tell ye he was a-peddlin' heads around town?

316
00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:50,867
But turn flukes again and go to sleep.

317
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:52,155
Queequeg, look here.

318
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:54,040
You savvy me, I savvy you.

319
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,322
This man sleep you.

320
00:30:55,363 --> 00:30:57,126
You, this man sleep you.

321
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,111
You, this man sleep you.

322
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,155
You, this man sleep you?

323
00:31:01,175 --> 00:31:02,338
You savvy?

324
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,810
Me savvy plenty, grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.

325
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:13,935
You get in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side.

326
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:18,323
He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way.

327
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,346
I stood looking at him a moment.

328
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:24,994
For all his tattooings, he was on the whole a clean, comely-looking cannibal.

329
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:29,342
What's all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself.

330
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:31,643
The man's a human being just as I am.

331
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:35,654
He has just as much reason to fear me as I have to be afraid of him.

332
00:31:36,215 --> 00:31:39,484
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.

333
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:45,035
Landlord, said I, tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it.

334
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:48,200
Tell him to stop smoking in short, and I will turn in with him.

335
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,305
But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me.

336
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:52,286
It's dangerous.

337
00:31:52,587 --> 00:31:54,029
Besides, I ain't insured.

338
00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:04,746
This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed, rolling over to one side as much as to say, I won't touch a leg of ye.

339
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:07,028
Good night, landlord," said I. You may go.

340
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:10,399
I turned in and never slept better in my life.
