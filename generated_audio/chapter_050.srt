Chapter 50 - Ahab's Boat and Crew. Fidela. Who would have thought it, Flask?

2
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:06,887
cried Stubb.

3
00:00:07,347 --> 00:00:12,915
If I had but one leg, you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plughole with my timber toe.

4
00:00:13,476 --> 00:00:15,058
Oh, he's a wonderful old man.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:19,565
I don't think it's so strange, after all, on that account, said Flask.

6
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:22,589
If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing.

7
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:28,097
That would disable him, but he has one knee, and good part of the other left, you know.

8
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,309
I don't know that, my little man.

9
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,272
I never yet saw him kneel.

10
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:45,614
Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase.

11
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:55,030
So Tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight.

12
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,054
But with Ahab, the question assumed a modified aspect.

13
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:18,540
Considering that with two legs, man is but a hobbling white in all times of danger, considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties, that every individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril, under these circumstances, is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale boat in the hunt?

14
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:24,207
As a general thing, the joint owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.

15
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:36,728
Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person,

16
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:53,753
Yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt, above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men as that same boat's crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod.

17
00:01:54,354 --> 00:02:00,621
Therefore, he had not solicited a boat's crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.

18
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:05,567
Nevertheless, he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter.

19
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:33,377
The sailors had little foreseen it, though to foreseen it, though, while pins had concluded the customary business of fitting the whale boats for service, when sometime after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making thull pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow, when all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat,

20
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:45,414
as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb, and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thighboard, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing.

21
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:59,213
But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick, for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.

22
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:06,003
But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat's crew being assigned to that boat.

23
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:13,995
Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away, for in a whaler wonders soon wane.

24
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:25,352
Besides, now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ashholes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers,

25
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:43,324
And the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whale boats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and whatnot, that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain.

26
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,195
and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.

27
00:03:47,816 --> 00:04:01,920
But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbined fadalla remained a muffled mystery to the last.

28
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:16,602
Whence he came in a mannerly world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes, nay, so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence, heaven knows,

29
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,673
it might have been even authority over him.

30
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:20,696
All this none knew.

31
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:25,545
But one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fidala.

32
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:37,847
He was such a creature as civilized, domestic people in the tempered zone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly, but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities,

33
00:04:37,827 --> 00:05:06,079
especially the Oriental Isles to the east of the continent, those insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of Earth's primal generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created, and to what end, when though, according to Genesis, the angels
