00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:08,995
Chapter 70 - The Sphinx. It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the Leviathan, he was beheaded.

2
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:19,126
Now, the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves, and not without reason.

3
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:23,771
Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck.

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:31,078
On the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that very place, is the thickest part of him.

5
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,623
Remember, also, that the surgeon must operate from above,

6
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:46,181
some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a discolored rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea.

7
00:00:47,122 --> 00:01:01,324
Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh, and in that subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made.

8
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:10,555
He must skillfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull.

9
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:17,343
Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb's boast that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?

10
00:01:18,164 --> 00:01:23,430
When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped.

11
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,458
That done, if it belonged to a small whale, it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of.

12
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:49,249
But, with a full-grown leviathan, this is impossible, for the sperm whale's head embraces nearly one-third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jeweler's scales.

13
00:01:49,229 --> 00:02:01,313
The Pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was hoisted against the ship's side, about halfway out of the sea, so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element.

14
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:09,128
And there, with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower masthead,

15
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:12,871
and every yardarm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves.

16
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:19,817
There, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod's waist like the giant Hall of Fairnesses from the girdle of Judith.

17
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:24,981
When this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went below to their dinner.

18
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:29,305
Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck.

19
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:38,693
An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless, measureless leaves upon the sea.

20
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:43,889
A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin.

21
00:02:43,909 --> 00:03:08,190
Taking a few turns on the quarterdeck, he paused to gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main chains he took Stub's long spade, still remaining there after the whale's decapitation, and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended mass, placed its other end, crutchwise, under one arm, and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.

22
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:15,597
It was a black and hooded head, and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm, it seemed the sphinxes in the desert.

23
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:25,047
Speak, thou vast and venerable head, muttered Ahab, which, though ungarnished with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses.

24
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:29,391
Speak, mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee.

25
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:32,895
Of all divers thou hast dived the deepest.

26
00:03:32,993 --> 00:03:38,122
That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, Has moved amid this world's foundations.

27
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:53,888
Where unrecorded names and navies rust, And untold hopes and anchors rot, Where in her murderous hold this frigid earth Is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned, There, in that awful water-land, There was thy most familiar home.

28
00:03:53,868 --> 00:04:03,068
Thou hast been where bell or diver never went, hast slept by many a sailor's side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down.

29
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:13,149
Thou saw'st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship, heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave, true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them.

30
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,257
Thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck.

31
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:24,927
For hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw, and his murderers still sailed on unharmed.

32
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:31,958
While swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing arms,

33
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:38,825
O head, thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine.

34
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,327
Sail ho!

35
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:43,550
cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast head.

36
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,571
Aye?

37
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:52,159
Well now, that's cheering, cried Ahab, suddenly erecting himself, while whole thunderclouds swept aside from his brow.

38
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,405
That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man.

39
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:58,204
Where away?

40
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:03,049
Three points on the starboard bow, sir, And bringing down her breeze to us.

41
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,973
Better and better, man, Would now St.

42
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:09,957
Paul would come along that way, And to my breezelessness bring his breeze.

43
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:13,041
O nature, and O soul of man!

44
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:16,926
How far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies!

45
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:22,532
Not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, But has its cunning duplicate in mind.
