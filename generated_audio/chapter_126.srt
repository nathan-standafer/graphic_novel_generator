00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:13,939
Chapter 126 - The Life-Buoy. Steering now southeastward by Ahab's leveled steel and her progress solely determined by Ahab's level log and line, the Pequod held on her path towards the equator.

2
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:30,595
Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild, all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.

3
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:52,802
At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the equatorial fishing ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets, the Watch, then headed by Flask, was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly, like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod's murdered innocents,

4
00:00:52,782 --> 00:01:05,639
That one and all, they started from their reveries and for the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave while that wild cry remained within hearing.

5
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:12,928
The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids and shuddered, but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled.

6
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:22,300
Yet the Gray Manx man, the oldest mariner of all, declared that the wild, thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.

7
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:27,368
Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he came to the deck.

8
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,403
It was then recounted to him by flask, not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings.

9
00:01:33,186 --> 00:01:36,576
He hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder.

10
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:52,860
Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail.

11
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:10,879
But this only the more affected some of them, because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside.

12
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,025
In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.

13
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:23,326
but the boatings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning.

14
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:45,358
At sunrise this man went from his hammock to his masthead at the fore, and whether it was that he was not yet half-weight from his sleep, for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state, whether it was thus with the man, there is now no telling, but, be that as it may, he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard, a cry and a rushing,

15
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:52,690
And looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air, and looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea.

16
00:02:53,532 --> 00:03:00,724
The lifebuoy, a long slender cask, was dropped from the stern, where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring.

17
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:11,802
But no hand rose to seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore.

18
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:18,852
And the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.

19
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:29,487
And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale, on the white whale's own peculiar ground, that man was swallowed up in the deep.

20
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:32,521
but few, perhaps, thought of that at the time.

21
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:46,682
Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a portent, for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfillment of an evil already presaged.

22
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:51,422
They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before.

23
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:57,692
But again the old manksman said, Nay, the lost life buoy was now to be replaced.

24
00:03:58,293 --> 00:04:13,817
Starbuck was directed to sea to it, but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be.

25
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:24,738
Therefore, they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and innuendos, Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.

26
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:28,064
A life buoy of a coffin, cried Starbuck, starting.

27
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:30,929
Rather queer that, I should say, said Stubb.

28
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,394
It will make a good enough one, said Flask.

29
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:35,518
The carpenter here can arrange it easily.

30
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:40,113
Bring it up, there's nothing else for it, said Starbuck, after a melancholy pause.

31
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:43,458
Rig it, carpenter, do not look at me so, the coffin, I mean.

32
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:44,660
Dost thou hear me?

33
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,361
Rig it.

34
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:49,567
And shall I nail down the lid, sir, moving his hand as with a hammer?

35
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:50,649
Aye.

36
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:55,296
And shall I caulk the seams, sir, moving his hand as with a caulking iron?

37
00:04:55,276 --> 00:05:00,065
Aye, and shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir, moving his hand as with a pitch-pot?

38
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:02,250
Away, what possesses thee to this?

39
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,875
Make a life buoy of the coffin, and no more.

40
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:07,881
Mr. Stub, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.

41
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:11,949
He goes off in a huff, the whole he can endure at the parts he balks.

42
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:13,371
Now I don't like this.

43
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:17,740
I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like a gentleman.

44
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,387
But I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won't put his head into it.

45
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,773
Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin?

46
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:27,658
And now I'm ordered to make a lifebuoy of it.

47
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:32,406
It's like turning an old coat, going to bring the flesh on the other side now.

48
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,712
I don't like this cobbling sort of business.

49
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:36,773
I don't like it at all.

50
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:38,235
It's undignified.

51
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:39,537
It's not my place.

52
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:42,000
Let tinker's brats do tinkerings.

53
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,141
We are their betters.

54
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:48,848
I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair and square mathematical jobs.

55
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:55,617
Something that regularly begins at the beginning and is at the middle when midway and comes to an end at the conclusion.

56
00:05:55,997 --> 00:06:00,022
Not a cobbler's job that's at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end.

57
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:03,927
It's the old woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs.

58
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:07,315
Lord, what an affection all old women have for tinkers.

59
00:06:07,997 --> 00:06:21,831
I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once, and that's the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job shop in the vineyard, they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me.

60
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:25,514
But hi-ho, there are no caps at sea but snowcaps.

61
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:26,778
Let me see.

62
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:35,466
Nail down the lid, caulk the seams, pay over the same with pitch, batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap spring over the ship's stern.

63
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,628
Were ever such things done before with a coffin?

64
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:44,176
Some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied up in the rigging ere they would do the job.

65
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:51,666
But I'm made of Nadia Roostook hemlock, I don't budge, cruppered with a coffin, sailing about with a graveyard tray.

66
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:52,688
But never mind.

67
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:59,057
We workers in woods make bridal bedsteads and card tables as well as coffins and hearses.

68
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:10,060
We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit, not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can.

69
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,084
Hem, I'll do the job, now, tenderly.

70
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:14,045
I'll have me.

71
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,430
Let's see how many in the ship's company, all told.

72
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:18,732
But I've forgotten.

73
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:27,144
Anyway, I'll have me thirty separate, Turks-headed lifelines, each three feet long, hanging all round to the coffin.

74
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:36,537
Then, if the hull go down, there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun.

75
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:42,291
Come hammer, caulking iron, pitch pot and marling, spike, let's to it.
