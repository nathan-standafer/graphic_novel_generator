Chapter 113 - The Forge

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:21,927
With matted beard and swathed in a bristling sharkskin apron, about midday, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed upon an ironwood log, with one hand holding a pikehead in the coals, and with the other at his forge's lungs, when Captain Ahab came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag.

3
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:31,658
While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused, till at last Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the anvil,

4
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:37,025
The red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.

5
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:40,170
Are these thy mother Carrie's chickens, Perth?

6
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:44,916
They are always flying in thy wake, birds of good omen, too, but not to all.

7
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:46,358
Look here, they burn.

8
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,843
But thou, thou livest among them without a scorch.

9
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:56,312
Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab, answered Perth, resting for a moment on his hammer.

10
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:59,823
I am past scorching, not easily canst thou scorch a scar.

11
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:01,586
Well, well, no more.

12
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:05,752
Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful to me.

13
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,702
In no paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery and others that is not mad.

14
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:13,926
Thou shouldst go mad, blacksmith, say.

15
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:15,789
Why dost thou not go mad?

16
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,733
How canst thou not go mad?

17
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,599
How canst thou endure without being mad?

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,687
Do the heavens yet hate thee, that thou canst not go mad?

19
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:26,570
What wert thou making there?

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,159
Welding an old pikehead, sir, there were seams and dents in it.

21
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:35,844
And canst thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard usage as it had?

22
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:37,325
I think so, sir.

23
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:43,652
And I suppose thou canst smooth almost any seams and dents, never mind how hard the metal, blacksmith.

24
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:47,115
Ay, sir, I think I can, all seams and dents but one.

25
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:53,942
Look ye here, then, cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning with both hands on Perth's shoulders.

26
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:55,163
Look ye here!

27
00:01:55,223 --> 00:01:56,104
Here!

28
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:57,906
Here!

29
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:02,677
Can ye smooth out a seam like this, blacksmith, sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow?

30
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:10,596
If thou couldst, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.

31
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:13,229
Answer, canst thou smooth this seam?

32
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:18,218
O, that is the one, sir, said I, not all seams and dents but one.

33
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,883
Ay, blacksmith, it is the one.

34
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:28,135
Ay, man, it is unsmoothable, for though thou only seest it here in my flesh, it is wort down into the bone of my skull.

35
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,919
That is all wrinkles.

36
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,727
But, away with child's play, no more gaffs and pikes to-day.

37
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:35,643
Looky here!"

38
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,509
jingling the leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins.

39
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,837
I too want a harpoon made, one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part.

40
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:48,783
Perth, something that will stick in a whale like his own fin bone.

41
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:52,228
There's the stuff, flinging the pouch upon the anvil.

42
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:58,217
Looky, blacksmith, these are the gathered nail stubs of the steel shoes of racing horses.

43
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:00,188
Horseshoe stubs, sir?

44
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:06,996
Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.

45
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:13,144
I know it, old man, these stubs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers.

46
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:25,200
Quick, forge me the harpoon, and forge me first twelve rods for its shank, then wind and twist, and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a toe-line.

47
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:26,785
Quick, I'll blow the fire."

48
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:36,542
When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by spiraling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt.

49
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,387
A flaw, rejecting the last one.

50
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:41,371
Work that over again, Perth.

51
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:46,159
This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one,

52
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,965
when Ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron.

53
00:03:50,746 --> 00:04:01,843
As then, with regular gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard-pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame.

54
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:09,574
The Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil.

55
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:14,121
But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.

56
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:16,911
What's that bunch of Lucifers dodging about there for?

57
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:19,680
muttered Stubb, looking on from the forecastle.

58
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:26,203
That Parsee smells fire like a Fusee, and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powderpam.

59
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:38,891
At last the shank and one complete rod received its final heat, and as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water nearby, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face.

60
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,954
Wouldst thou brand me Perth?

61
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:43,357
wincing for a moment with the pain.

62
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:47,162
Have I been but forging my own branding iron then?

63
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:48,579
Pray God not that.

64
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,884
Yet I fear something, Captain Ahab.

65
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:53,228
Is not this harpoon for the white whale?

66
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:54,771
For the white fiend?

67
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:58,237
But now for the barbs thou must make them thyself, man.

68
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:05,590
Here are my razors, the best of steel here, and make the barbs sharp as the needle-sleed of the icy sea.

69
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,877
For a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them.

70
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:11,239
Take them, man.

71
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:18,812
I have no need for them, for I now neither shave, sup, nor pray tillâ€”but here, to work.

72
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:27,747
Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron.

73
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:35,700
And as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water cask near.

74
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:38,846
No, no, no water for that.

75
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:40,829
I want it of the true death-temper.

76
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,151
Ahoy there!

77
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:44,435
Tash-tego, kwee-kweg, dagu!

78
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:45,857
What say ye, pagans?

79
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:48,562
Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?

80
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:52,789
Holding it high up, a cluster of dark nods replied, Yes.

81
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,336
Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the white whale's barbs were then tempered.

82
00:05:57,797 --> 00:06:10,036
Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine patris, sed in nomine tiaboli, deliriously howled Ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood.

83
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:19,350
Now, mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end of the socket of the iron.

84
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:25,963
A coil of new towline was then unwound and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension.

85
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:36,179
Pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harp string, then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, Good, and now for the seizings.

86
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:44,832
At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon.

87
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:47,575
The pole was then driven hard up into the socket.

88
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:55,765
From the lower end the rope was traced halfway along the pole's length and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine.

89
00:06:56,586 --> 00:07:01,692
This done, pole, iron, and rope, like the three fates, remained inseparable.

90
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:11,123
And Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon, the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank.

91
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:16,780
But ere he entered his cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard.

92
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:18,124
O Pip!

93
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:29,196
thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye, all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it.
