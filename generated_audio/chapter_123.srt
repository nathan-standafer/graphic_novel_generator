00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:02,785
Chapter 123 - The Musket.

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:20,255
During the most violent shocks of the typhoon, the man at the Pequod's jawbone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached to it, for they were slack, because some play to the tiller was indispensable.

3
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:31,472
In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round.

4
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:40,459
It was thus with the Pequods at almost every shock the helmsmen had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards.

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,586
It is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwanted emotion.

6
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:56,481
Some hours after midnight, the typhoon abated so much that through the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb, one engaged forward and the other aft,

7
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:10,082
The shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main top sails were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying away to leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.

8
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:27,328
the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a storm-trisail was set further aft, so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again, and the course, for the present, east-south-east, which he was to steer if practicable, was once more given to the helmsman.

9
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:38,501
For during the violence of the gale he had only steered according to its vicissitudes, but as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo, a good sign!

10
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:43,110
The wind seemed coming round astern, ay, the foul breeze became fair.

11
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:50,683
Instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of, Hey Joe, the fair wind, oh, ye ho, cheerly men!

12
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:57,056
the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it.

13
00:01:57,757 --> 00:02:16,148
In compliance with the standing order of his commander to report immediately and at any one of the twenty-four hours any decided change in the affairs of the deck, Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze, however reluctantly and gloomily, than he mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.

14
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:20,414
Air knocking at his stateroom, he involuntarily paused before it a moment.

15
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:34,407
The cabin lamp, taking long swings this way and that, was burning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the old man's bolted door, a thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place of upper panels.

16
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:41,937
The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements.

17
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:48,365
The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead.

18
00:02:49,266 --> 00:03:03,465
Starbuck was an honest, upright man, but out of Starbuck's heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought, but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.

19
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:05,624
He would have shot me once, he murmured.

20
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,247
Yes, there's the very musket that he pointed at me.

21
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:10,029
That one with the studded stock.

22
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:10,990
Let me touch it.

23
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,590
Lift it.

24
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:12,611
Lift it.

25
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:16,636
Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances.

26
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:19,138
Strange, that I should shake so now.

27
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:19,939
Loaded?

28
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,120
I must see.

29
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,322
Aye, aye, and powder in the pan.

30
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,263
That's not good.

31
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:25,425
Best spill it.

32
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:26,125
Wait.

33
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:27,747
I'll cure myself of this.

34
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:30,550
I'll hold the musket boldly while I think.

35
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,374
I come to report a fair wind to him.

36
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,476
But how fair?

37
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:35,199
Fair for death and doom.

38
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,903
That's fair for Moby Dick.

39
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:40,209
It's a fair wind that's only fair for that accursed fish.

40
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,454
The very tube he pointed at me.

41
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:43,736
The very one.

42
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:44,658
This one.

43
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,241
I hold it here.

44
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:49,247
He would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.

45
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:51,884
I and he would fain kill all his crew.

46
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:55,768
Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale?

47
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:58,230
Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant?

48
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:05,397
And in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way, by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log?

49
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:10,102
And in this very typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods?

50
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:16,348
But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom with him?

51
00:04:16,784 --> 00:04:28,165
Yes, it would make him the willful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm, and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way.

52
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:33,595
If then he were this instant, put aside, that crime would not be his.

53
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:34,188
Ha!

54
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:35,970
Is he muttering in his sleep?

55
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:36,771
Ha!

56
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:38,392
Is he muttering in his sleep?

57
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:41,235
Yes, just there, in there, he's sleeping.

58
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:42,376
Sleeping?

59
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:45,419
Ay, but still alive, and soon awake again.

60
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,641
I can't withstand thee then, old man.

61
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:52,926
Not reasoning, not remonstrance, not entreaty wilt thou hearken to, all this thou scornest.

62
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:57,090
Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest.

63
00:04:57,751 --> 00:05:01,995
Ay, and sayest the men have vowed thy vow, sayest all of us are Ahabs.

64
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,257
Great God forbid!

65
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:06,882
But is there no other way, sayest all of us are Ahabs?

66
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,244
No lawful way?

67
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:10,808
Make him a prisoner to be taken home?

68
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,856
What, hope to wrest this old man's living power from his own living hands?

69
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:17,959
Only a fool would try it.

70
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,871
Say he were pinioned even, knotted all over with ropes and hosers, chained down to ring bolts on this cabin floor.

71
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,316
He would be more hideous than a caged tiger then.

72
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:39,015
I could not endure the sight, could not possibly fly his howlings, all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage.

73
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:40,777
What then remains?

74
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:44,522
The land is hundreds of leagues away, and Lakhchapan the nearest.

75
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:51,591
I stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law.

76
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:53,094
Ay, ay, tis so.

77
00:05:53,114 --> 00:06:00,209
Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin together?

78
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:09,748
And would I be a murderer then, if, and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket's end against the door?

79
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:13,294
On this level Ahab's hammock swings within, his head this way.

80
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:17,721
A touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.

81
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:21,588
O Mary, Mary, boy, boy, boy!

82
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:29,641
But if I wake thee not to death, old man, who can tell to what unsounded deep Starbuck's body this day weak may sink, with all the crew?

83
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,645
Great God, where art thou?

84
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:32,566
Shall I?

85
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:33,728
Shall I?

86
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:36,508
The wind has gone down and shifted, sir.

87
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:39,734
The fore and main top sails are reefed and set.

88
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:40,836
She heads her course.

89
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:42,059
Stern all.

90
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:45,906
Oh, Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last.

91
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,818
Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's tormented sleep.

92
00:06:51,798 --> 00:06:55,844
as if Starbuck's voice had caused the long, dumb dream to speak.

93
00:06:56,966 --> 00:07:00,611
The yet-leveled musket shook like a drunkard's arm against the panel.

94
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:08,082
Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel, but turning from the door, he placed the death tube in its rack and left the place.

95
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:10,505
He's too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb.

96
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:14,652
Go thou down and wake him and tell him, I must see to the deck here.

97
00:07:14,692 --> 00:07:16,995
Thou knowest what to say.
