Chapter 65 - The Whale as a Dish.

2
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:11,049
Chapter 65 - The Whale as a Dish. That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and, like Stub, eat him by his own light, as you may say.

3
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:17,139
This seems so outlandish, a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:25,853
It is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the right whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large prices there.

5
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:38,405
Also, that in Henry VIII's time, a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbecued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of whale.

6
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:42,529
Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating.

7
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:50,597
The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle balls or veal balls.

8
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:54,220
The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them.

9
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,274
They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.

10
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:04,934
The fact is that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him.

11
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:11,261
But when you come to sit down before a meat pie nearly 100 feet long, it takes away your appetite.

12
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:19,650
Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales, but the Eskimo are not so fastidious.

13
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:26,097
We all know how they live upon whales and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil.

14
00:01:26,077 --> 00:01:33,429
Zogronda, one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing.

15
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:47,511
And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel, that these men actually lived for several months on the moldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber.

16
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:59,280
Among the Dutch whalemen, these scraps are called fritters, which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives' doughnuts or Olie Cook's when fresh.

17
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:05,314
They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.

18
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:10,001
But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness.

19
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:14,067
He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be delicately good.

20
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:21,377
Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo's, which is esteemed a rare dish, were it not such a solid pyramid of fat.

21
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:33,715
But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is, like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a coconut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter.

22
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,574
Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it.

23
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:49,915
In the long try watches of the night, it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship biscuit into the huge oil pots and let them fry there a while.

24
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:52,132
Many a good supper have I thus made.

25
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:56,759
In the case of a small sperm whale, the brains are accounted a fine dish.

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:15,447
The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump whitish lobes being withdrawn, precisely resembling two large puddings, they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head, which is quite a dish among some epicures.

27
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:30,580
And everyone knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves' brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf's head from their own heads, which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination.

28
00:03:31,381 --> 00:03:38,487
And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent-looking calf's head before him is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see.

29
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:44,472
The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him with an et tu brute expression.

30
00:03:44,772 --> 00:04:02,550
It is not, perhaps, entirely, because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence, that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned, i.e., that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.

31
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:07,735
But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer.

32
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:09,717
Perhaps he was hung.

33
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:16,699
And if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been, and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does.

34
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:24,668
Go to the meat market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds.

35
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,392
Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal's jaw?

36
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:29,574
Cannibals?

37
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,396
Who is not a cannibal?

38
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:39,265
I tell you it will be more tolerable for the phagy that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine.

39
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:52,020
It will be more tolerable for that provident phagy, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pâté de foie gras.

40
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:55,785
But, stub, he eats the whale by its own light, does he?

41
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,909
And that is adding insult to injury, is it?

42
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:05,877
Look at your knife-handle, there, my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef.

43
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:07,219
What is that handle made of?

44
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:10,963
What but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating?

45
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:17,670
And what do you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose, with a feather of the same fowl?

46
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:24,838
And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indict his circulars?

47
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:32,387
It is only within the last month or two that that Society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens.
