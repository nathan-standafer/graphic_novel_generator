00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:08,743
Chapter 134 - The Chase-Second Day. At daybreak the three mastheads were punctually manned afresh.

2
00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:10,325
"'Di see him?'

3
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:13,690
cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,132
"'See nothing, sir.

5
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:17,195
Turn up all hands and make sail.

6
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:21,481
He travels faster than I thought for, the top gallant sails, i.e.

7
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:23,103
they should have been kept on her all night.

8
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,528
But no matter, tis but resting for the rush."

9
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:38,258
Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South Sea fishery.

10
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:49,157
For such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders.

11
00:00:49,137 --> 00:01:06,240
that from the simple observation of a whale when last described, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.

12
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:17,254
And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast whose general trending he well knows and which he desires shortly to return to again.

13
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:38,061
But at some further point, like as this pilot stands by his compass and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit a right the remote unseen headland, eventually to be visited, so does the fisherman at his compass with the whale, for after being chased and diligently marked through several hours of daylight,

14
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:58,176
Then, when night obscures the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the pike, so that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing rid in water, awake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land.

15
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:16,573
And as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse, and lightly say of it, The up-train or the down-train will reach such or such a spot.

16
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:24,501
At such or such an hour, even so, almost, there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep.

17
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:36,494
according to the observed humor of his speed, and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude.

18
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:53,914
But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies, for of what present avail to the becalmed or wind-bound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port.

19
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:59,723
Inferable from these statements are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales.

20
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:08,316
The ship Tauron, leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannonball, missent, becomes a plowshare and turns up the level field.

21
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:15,486
Buy salt and hemp, cried Stubb, but this swift motion of the deck creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart.

22
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:18,771
This ship and I are two brave fellows,

23
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:19,305
Ha!

24
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:19,745
Ha!

25
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:26,077
Someone take me up and launch me spine-wise on the sea for by live oaks, my spine's a keel.

26
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:26,878
Ha!

27
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:27,279
Ha!

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,385
We go the gate that leaves no dust behind.

29
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:33,591
There she blows, she blows, she blows.

30
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:37,097
Right ahead was now the masthead cry.

31
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:38,679
"'Aye, aye,' cried Stubb.

32
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:39,400
"'I knew it.

33
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:40,562
Ye can't escape.

34
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:43,045
Blow on and split your spout, O whale.

35
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,509
The mad fiend himself is after ye.

36
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,032
Blow your trump, blister your lungs.

37
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:52,679
Ahab will dam off your blood as a miller shuts his water-gate upon the stream.'

38
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,925
And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew.

39
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:02,095
The frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up like old wine worked anew.

40
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:17,125
Whatever pale fears and foreboding some of them might have felt before, these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up and on all sides routed as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison.

41
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:32,734
The hand of fate had snatched all their souls, and by the stirring perils of the previous day, the rack of the past night's suspense, the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark,

42
00:04:32,714 --> 00:04:35,699
By all these things, their hearts were bowled along.

43
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:48,242
The wind that made great bellies of their sails and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible, this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.

44
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:51,668
They were one man, not thirty.

45
00:04:51,648 --> 00:05:08,475
for as the one ship that held them all, though it was put together of all contrasting things, oak and maple and pinewood, iron and pitch and hemp, yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the long central keel.

46
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:23,933
Even so, all the individualities of the crew—this man's valor, that man's fear, guilt, and guiltiness—all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab, their one lord in Keel, did point to—the rigging lived.

47
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:29,043
The mastheads, like the tops of tall palms, were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs.

48
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:34,753
Clinging to a spar with one hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings.

49
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:44,892
Others, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards, all the spars and full bearing of mortals ready and right for their fate.

50
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:45,353
Ah!

51
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:50,786
how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them.

52
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:54,013
Why sing ye not out for him if ye see him?

53
00:05:54,414 --> 00:06:00,248
cried Ahab, when, after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.

54
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,370
Sway me up, men, ye have been deceived.

55
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,114
Not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way and then disappears."

56
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:15,782
It was even so, in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved.

57
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:28,834
For hardly had Ahab reached his perch, hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the keynote to an orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles.

58
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:37,892
The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard as much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead.

59
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:53,893
Moby Dick bodily burst into view, for not by any calm and indolent spoutings, not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the white whale now reveal his vicinity, but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.

60
00:06:53,873 --> 00:07:08,932
Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more.

61
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:14,699
In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes off seem his main.

62
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:19,485
In some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.

63
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,406
There she breaches!

64
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:22,108
There she breaches!

65
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:28,822
was the cry as in his immeasurable bravados, the white whale tossed himself salmon-like to heaven.

66
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:50,290
So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier, and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a veil.

67
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,954
"'Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick,' cried Ahab.

68
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,737
"'Thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand.

69
00:07:56,757 --> 00:08:00,541
"'Down, down all of ye, but one man at the fore.

70
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:02,863
"'The boats, stand by.'

71
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:16,918
Unmindful of the tedious rope ladders of the shrouds, the men, like shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and halyards, while Ahab, less dartingly but still rapidly, was dropped from his perch.

72
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:20,628
Lower away, he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat.

73
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:23,675
A spare one rigged the afternoon previous.

74
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:26,382
Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine.

75
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:29,150
Keep away from the boats, but keep near them.

76
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,874
Lower all.

77
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:40,458
As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three crews.

78
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:49,774
Ahab's boat was central, and cheering his men, he told them he would take the whale head and head, that is, pull straight up to his forehead.

79
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:57,092
A not uncommon thing, for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision.

80
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:06,936
But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his eye, the white whale churning himself into furious speed,

81
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:22,950
Almost in an instant, as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side, and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.

82
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,618
but skillfully maneuvered, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field.

83
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:30,763
The boats for a while eluded him, though, at times.

84
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:38,897
But by a plank's breath, while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.

85
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:55,397
But at last, in his untraceable evolutions, the white whale so crossed and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him.

86
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:01,384
Though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous charge.

87
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:05,509
Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line,

88
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:12,998
and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again, hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls, when lo!

89
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:16,883
a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks.

90
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:30,602
Caught and twisted, corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing and dripping up to the chocks and the bows of Ahab's boat.

91
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:32,063
Only one thing could be done.

92
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:38,089
Seizing the boat knife, he critically reached within, through, and then without.

93
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:51,603
The rays of steel dragged in the line beyond, past it, inboard, to the bozeman, and then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks, dropped the intercepted faggot of steel into the sea and was all fast again.

94
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:57,889
That instant, the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines.

95
00:10:58,038 --> 00:11:22,813
by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stub and flask towards his flukes, dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch.

96
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:48,565
while the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after the revolving line tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while a slope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks, and Stubb was lustily singing out for someone to ladle him up, and while the old man's line, now parting, admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could,

97
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:57,309
In that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils, Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wires.

98
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:14,097
As arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the sea, the white whale dashed to the first uprising momentum of the whale, modifying its direction as he struck the surface, involuntarily launched him along it, to a little distance from the center of the destruction he had made,

99
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:19,546
And with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side.

100
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:31,005
And whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back and came sideways smiting the sea.

101
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:44,657
But soon, as if satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleaded forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way at a traveler's methodic pace.

102
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:58,059
As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating mariners, tubs, oars and whatever else could be caught at, and safely landed them on her decks.

103
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:09,472
Some sprained shoulders, wrists and ankles, livid contusions, wrenched harpoons and lances, inextricable intricacies of rope, shattered oars and planks.

104
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:11,775
All these were there.

105
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:15,561
But no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen anyone.

106
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:29,022
As with Fedala the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat's broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float, nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day's mishap.

107
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:39,624
But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him, as instead of standing by himself he still half hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him.

108
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:44,611
His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short, sharp splinter.

109
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:53,423
Aye, aye, Starbuck, tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he will, and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.

110
00:13:53,403 --> 00:13:57,029
The feral has not stood, sir," said the carpenter, now coming up.

111
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,052
I put good work into that leg.

112
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:03,199
But no bone's broken, sir, I hope," said Stubb with true concern.

113
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,004
Aye, and all splintered to pieces, Stubb.

114
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:06,765
Dicey it.

115
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:16,120
But even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched, and I account no living bone of mine, one jot more me than this dead one that's lost.

116
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:23,897
Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend Can so much as graze old Ahab In his own proper and inaccessible being.

117
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:28,427
Can any lead touch yonder floor, Any mast scrape yonder roof?

118
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,351
Aloft there, which way?

119
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,877
Dead to leeward, sir.

120
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:41,512
Uphelm then, pile on the sail again, ship-keepers, Down the rest of the spare boats and rig them, Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat's crews.

121
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:44,196
Let me first help thee towards the bulwark, sir.

122
00:14:44,236 --> 00:14:48,544
Oh, oh, oh, how this splinter gores me now!

123
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:53,773
A cursed fate that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!

124
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:58,020
Sir, my body-man, not thee!

125
00:14:58,237 --> 00:14:59,639
Give me something for a cane.

126
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,862
There that shivered Lance will do.

127
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:03,545
Muster the men.

128
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:05,708
Surely I have not seen him yet.

129
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:07,691
By heaven it cannot be.

130
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:08,412
Missing.

131
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:09,514
Quick.

132
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,217
Call them all."

133
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:12,939
The old man's hinted thought was true.

134
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,785
Upon mustering the company, the Parsi was not there.

135
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:17,736
The Parsi!"

136
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:18,998
cried Stubb.

137
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,380
He must have been caught in.

138
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,443
The black vomit wrench thee.

139
00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:24,066
Run all of ye above.

140
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:24,787
Allow.

141
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:25,508
Cabin.

142
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:26,410
Forecastle.

143
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,091
Find him.

144
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:27,952
Not gone.

145
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:28,873
Not gone.

146
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:33,761
But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsi was nowhere to be found.

147
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:37,587
I, sir," said Stubb, caught among the tangles of your line.

148
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:40,191
I thought I saw him dragging under.

149
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:44,755
My line, my line, gone, gone, gone, gone.

150
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,357
What means that little word?

151
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:47,398
What death?

152
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:48,339
Nell rings in it.

153
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:51,001
That old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.

154
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:52,462
The harpoon, too.

155
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:54,324
Toss over the litter there.

156
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:54,965
Do you see it?

157
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:56,626
The forged iron, men.

158
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:59,529
The white whales, no, no, no, blistered fool.

159
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,250
This hand did dart it.

160
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:03,192
Tis in the fish, aloft there.

161
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:04,373
Keep him nailed.

162
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,996
Quick, all hands to the rigging of the boats.

163
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:09,418
Collect the oars, harpooneers.

164
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:11,882
The irons, the irons, hoist the royals higher.

165
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:14,206
A pull on all the sheets, helm there.

166
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:16,470
Steady, steady for your life.

167
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:19,194
All ten times girdle the unmeasured globe.

168
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,917
Yea, and dive straight through it.

169
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:22,199
But I'll slay him yet.

170
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,728
Great God, but for one single instant show thyself, cried Starbuck.

171
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:30,973
Never, never wilt thou capture him, old man.

172
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:33,838
In Jesus' name, no more of this.

173
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:36,182
That's worse than devil's madness.

174
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:44,652
Two days chased, twice stove to splinters, Thy very leg once more snatched from under thee, Thy evil shadow gone.

175
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:49,957
All good angels mobbing thee with warnings, What more wits thou have?

176
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:54,641
Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish Till he swamps the last man?

177
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:58,144
Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea?

178
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,527
Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?

179
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:06,912
Oh, oh, impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!

180
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:14,386
Starbuck of late I felt strangely moved to thee, Ever since that hour we both saw, Thou know'st what in one another's eyes.

181
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:21,478
But in this matter of the whale, Be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand, A lipless, unfeatured blank.

182
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,023
Ahab is forever Ahab, man.

183
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,476
This whole act's immutably decreed.

184
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:30,602
Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled.

185
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:33,266
Fool, I am the fates' lieutenant.

186
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:34,708
I act under orders.

187
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:37,773
Look thou, underling, that thou obeyest mine.

188
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:39,175
Stand round me, men.

189
00:17:40,177 --> 00:17:45,485
Ye see an old man cut down to the stump, leaning on a shivered lance, propped up on a lonely foot.

190
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:52,255
Tis Ahab, his body's part, but Ahab's soul's a centipede that moves upon a hundred legs.

191
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:58,227
I feel strained, half-stranded, as ropes that tow Dismasted frigates in a gale, and I may look so.

192
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:05,822
But ere I break, ye'll hear me crack, and till ye hear that, Know that Ahab's hauser tows his purpose yet.

193
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,804
Believe ye, men, in the things called omens?

194
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:19,217
Then laugh aloud and cry encore, for ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface, then rise again to sink forevermore.

195
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:24,123
So with Moby Dick, two days he's floated, tomorrow will be the third.

196
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:28,629
Ay, men, he'll rise once more, but only to spout his last.

197
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,292
Do you feel, brave men, brave?

198
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:34,476
As fearless fire, cried Stubb.

199
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:45,718
And as mechanical, muttered Ahab, then as the men went forward he muttered on, the things called omens, and yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat.

200
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,745
Oh, how valiantly I seek to drive out of others' hearts what's clinched so fast in mine!

201
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:56,051
The Parsi, the Parsi, gone, gone!

202
00:18:56,792 --> 00:19:01,117
And he was to go before, but still was to be seen again ere I could perish.

203
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,079
How's that?

204
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:07,981
There's a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judges.

205
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,589
Like a hawk's beak it pecks my brain.

206
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:15,162
I'll, I'll, I'll solve it though.

207
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:19,093
When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.

208
00:19:19,714 --> 00:19:36,340
So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on the previous night, only the sound of hammers and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow.

209
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,014
Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab's wrecked craft, the carpenter made him another leg.

210
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:47,066
While still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle.

211
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:54,244
His hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial, sat due eastward for the earliest sun.
