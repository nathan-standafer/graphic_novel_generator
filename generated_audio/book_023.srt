00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,336
Book XXIII P. Enelope.

2
00:00:02,978 --> 00:00:04,862
Eventually recognizes her husband.

3
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:11,458
Eerily in the morning Ulysses, Telemachus, Eumaeus, and Philoetius leave the town.

4
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:16,391
Eurycleia now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear husband had come home.

5
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:23,438
Her aged knees became young again, and her feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her head to speak to her.

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:30,885
Wake up, Penelope, my dear child, she exclaimed, and see with your own eyes something that you have been wanting this long time past.

7
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:40,534
Ulysses has at last indeed come home again, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble in his house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his son.

8
00:00:40,514 --> 00:00:43,457
My good nurse," answered Penelope, you must be mad.

9
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:49,484
The gods sometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish people become sensible.

10
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:54,269
This is what they must have been doing to you, for you always used to be a reasonable person.

11
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:03,138
Why should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough already, talking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my eyes and closed them?

12
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,205
I have never slept so soundly from the day my poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name.

13
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,188
Go back again into the women's room.

14
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:17,879
If it had been anyone else who had woke me up to bring me such absurd news, I should have sent her away with a severe scolding.

15
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,262
As it is your age shall protect you."

16
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:25,270
My dear child, answered Eurycleia, I am not mocking you.

17
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,375
It is quite true as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again.

18
00:01:28,976 --> 00:01:32,381
He was the stranger whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister.

19
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:39,633
Telemachus knew all the time that he was come back, but kept his father's secret that he might have his revenge on all these wicked people.

20
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:45,722
Then Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Eurycleia, and wept for joy.

21
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:48,687
"'But my dear nurse,' said she, "'explain this to me.

22
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:56,780
If he has really come home, as you say, how did he manage to overcome the wicked suitors single-handed, seeing what a number of them there always were?'

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,366
"'I was not there,' answered Eurycleia, "'and do not know.

24
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,870
I only heard them groaning while they were being killed.

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:11,203
We sat crouching and huddled up in a corner of the women's room, with the doors closed, till your son came to fetch me because his father sent him.'

26
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:17,092
Then I found Ulysses standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all round him, one on top of the other.

27
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:23,883
You would have enjoyed it if you could have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and filth and looking just like a lion.

28
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:33,478
But the corpses are now all piled up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a great fire to purify the house with sulfur.

29
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:40,855
He has sent me to call you, so come with me that you may both be happy together after all, for now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled.

30
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:49,594
Your husband is come home to find both wife and son alive and well, and to take his revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved so badly to him.

31
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:54,266
My dear nurse, said Penelope, do not exult too confidently over all this.

32
00:02:54,787 --> 00:03:05,794
You know how delighted everyone would be to see Ulysses come home, more particularly myself and the son who has been born to both of us, but what you tell me cannot be really true.

33
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:10,838
It is some god who is angry with the suitors for their great wickedness, and has made an end of them.

34
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:18,526
For they respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity.

35
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:21,408
Ulysses is dead far away from the Achaean land.

36
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,090
He will never return home again."

37
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,635
Then Nurse Eurycleia said, My child, what are you talking about?

38
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:35,983
But you were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your husband is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own fireside at this very moment.

39
00:03:35,963 --> 00:03:38,026
Besides, I can give you another proof.

40
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:50,386
When I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave him and I wanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not let me and clapped his hands over my mouth, so come with me and I will make this bargain with you.

41
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:55,354
If I am deceiving you, you may have me killed by the most cruel death you can think of."

42
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:02,325
"'My dear nurse,' said Penelope, "'however wise you may be, you can hardly fathom the counsels of the gods.

43
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:08,595
Nevertheless, we will go in search of my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors and the man who has killed them."

44
00:04:09,297 --> 00:04:19,634
On this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she considered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband and question him, or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace him.

45
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:25,984
When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister, she sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire,

46
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:36,355
Against the wall at right angles led an eighty to that by which she had entered, while Ulysses sat near one of the bearing posts, looking upon the ground, and waiting to see what his brave wife would say to him when she saw him.

47
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:40,259
For a long time she sat silent, and as one lost in amazement.

48
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:48,047
At one moment she looked him full in the face, but then again directly she was misled by his shabby clothes, and failed to recognize him.

49
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:52,512
One eighty-one till Telemachus began to reproach her and said, Mother,

50
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,256
But you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name.

51
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:57,940
Why do you keep away from my father in this way?

52
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:02,026
Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?

53
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:09,578
No other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through so much.

54
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:12,542
But your heart always was as hard as a stone."

55
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:21,060
Penelope answered, My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I can find no words in which either to ask questions or to answer them.

56
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,423
I cannot even look him straight in the face.

57
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:35,040
Still, if he really is Ulysses come back to his own home again, we shall get to understand one another better by and by, for there are tokens with which we too are alone acquainted and which are hidden from all others.

58
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:42,951
Ulysses smiled at this and said to Telemachus, Let your mother put me to any proof she likes, she will make up her mind about it presently.

59
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,934
She rejects me for the moment and believes me to be somebody else.

60
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:51,639
Because I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on, let us, however, consider what we had better do next.

61
00:05:52,180 --> 00:06:06,794
When one man has killed another, even though he was not one who would leave many friends to take up his quarrel, the man who has killed him must still say goodbye to his friends and fly the country, whereas we have been killing the stay of a whole town and all the picked youth of Ithaca.

62
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,276
I would have you consider this matter.

63
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:11,741
Look to it yourself, father," answered Telemachus.

64
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:17,694
For they say you are the wisest counselor in the world, and that there is no other mortal man who can compare with you.

65
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:24,328
We will follow you with right good will, nor shall you find us fail you insofar as our strength holds out.

66
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:27,317
I will say what I think will be best," answered Ulysses.

67
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:29,499
First wash and put your shirts on.

68
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,463
Tell the maids also to go to their own room and dress.

69
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:49,624
Femius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if people outside here, or any of the neighbours, or someone going along the street happens to notice it, they may think there is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the death of the suitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to the woods upon my own land.

70
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:54,013
Once there we will settle which of the courses heaven vouchsafes us shall seem wisest.

71
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,299
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said.

72
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:00,946
First they washed and put their shirts on, while the women got ready.

73
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:05,976
Then Phemius took his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance.

74
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:13,366
The house re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the people outside said, I suppose the Queen has been getting married at last.

75
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:18,433
She ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to protect her husband's property until he comes home.

76
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:19,936
192.

77
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:24,522
This was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had been happening.

78
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:33,236
The upper servant Eurinomy washed and anointed Ulysses in his own house, and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made him look taller and stronger than before.

79
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:39,145
She also made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms.

80
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:46,797
She glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a skillful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva.

81
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:51,242
and his work is full of beauty, enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it.

82
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:56,969
He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left.

83
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,756
My dear, said he, heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever yet had.

84
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:08,683
No other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of absence,

85
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:10,305
and after having gone through so much.

86
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:16,375
But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me, I will sleep alone, for this woman has a heart as hard as iron.

87
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:27,972
My dear, answered Penelope, I have no wish to set myself up, nor to depreciate you, but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very well remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.

88
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:32,877
Nevertheless, Eurycleia, take his bed outside the bedchamber that he himself built.

89
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:38,863
Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets.

90
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:49,494
She said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, Wife, I am much displeased at what you have just been saying, who has been taking my bed from the place in which I left it.

91
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:57,182
He must have found it a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some god came and helped him to shift it.

92
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:05,678
There is no man living, however strong and in his prime, who could move it from its place, for it is a marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands.

93
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:11,830
There was a young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post.

94
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:18,563
I built my room round this with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them, and I made the doors strong and well-fitting.

95
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:22,167
Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive tree and left the stump standing.

96
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:32,019
This I dressed roughly from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter's tools well and skillfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood and making it into a bed prop.

97
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,308
I then bored a hole down the middle and made it the center post of my bed, at which I worked till I had finished it, inlaying it with gold and silver.

98
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:43,673
After this I stretched a hide of crimson leather from one side of it to the other,

99
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:52,508
So, you see, I know all about it, and I desire to learn whether it is still there, or whether anyone has been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its roots."

100
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:57,436
When she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke down.

101
00:09:58,117 --> 00:10:02,084
She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck, and kissed him.

102
00:10:02,104 --> 00:10:04,969
"'Do not be angry with me, Ulysses,' she cried.

103
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:09,897
"'You, who are the wisest of mankind, we have suffered, both of us.

104
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:13,783
Heaven has denied us the happiness of spending our youth and of growing old.

105
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:19,612
Together, do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you thus as soon as I saw you.

106
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:27,865
I have been shuddering all the time through fear that someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story, for there are many very wicked people going about.

107
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:36,559
Jove's daughter Helen would never have yielded herself to a man from a foreign country if she had known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and bring her back.

108
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:42,593
Heaven put it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought to that sin which has been the source of all our sorrows.

109
00:10:43,354 --> 00:11:02,378
Now, however, that you have convinced me by showing that you know all about our bed, which no human being has ever seen, but you and I, and a single maidservant, the daughter of actor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who keeps the doors of our room hard of belief, though I have been, I can mistrust no longer.

110
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:07,946
Then Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and faithful wife to his bosom.

111
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:23,987
As the sight of land is welcomed to men who are swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship with the fury of his winds and waves, a few alone reach the land, and these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves on firm ground and out of danger.

112
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:25,850
Even so was her husband.

113
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:32,078
Welcome to her, as she looked upon him, and she could not tear her two fair arms from about his neck.

114
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:49,408
Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined otherwise, and held night back in the far west, while she would not suffer dawn to leave Oceanus, nor to yoke the two steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear her onward to break the day upon mankind.

115
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:54,835
At last, however, Ulysses said, Wife, we have not yet reached the end of our troubles.

116
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:57,999
I have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo.

117
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:10,396
It is long and difficult, but I must go through with it, for thus the shade of Tiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I went down into Hades to ask about my return and that of my companions.

118
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:16,003
But now let us go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.

119
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:22,984
"'You shall go to bed as soon as you please,' replied Penelope, "'now that the gods have sent you home "'to your own good house and to your country.

120
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:28,349
"'But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it, "'tell me about the task that lies before you.

121
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:32,794
"'I shall have to hear about it later, "'so it is better that I should be told at once.'

122
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:37,338
"'My dear,' answered Ulysses, "'why should you press me to tell you?

123
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:40,841
"'Still, I will not conceal it from you, "'though you will not like it.

124
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,003
"'I do not like it myself.

125
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:51,534
for Tiresias bade me travel far and wide, carrying an oar, till I came to a country where the people have never heard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food.

126
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:55,760
They know nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship.

127
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:59,385
He gave me this certain token which I will not hide from you.

128
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:05,413
He said that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel that I had on my shoulder.

129
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:16,309
On this I was to fix my oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune, after which I was to go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven, one after the other.

130
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:26,423
As for myself, he said that deaths should come to me from the sea and that my life should ebb away very gently when I was full of years and peace of mind and my people should bless me.

131
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:28,866
All this, he said, should surely come to pass.

132
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:37,438
And Penelope said, If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier time in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite from misfortune.

133
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:39,300
Thus did they converse.

134
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:43,766
Meanwhile, Eurynome and the nurse took torches and made the bed ready with soft coverlets.

135
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:53,119
As soon as they had laid them, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest, leaving the bedchamber woman Eurynome Nathree to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed by torchlight.

136
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:58,528
When she had conducted them to their room she went back, and they then came joyfully to the rights of their own old bed.

137
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:04,218
Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and made the women leave off also.

138
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,243
They then laid themselves down to sleep in the cloisters.

139
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:12,492
When Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love, they fell talking with one another.

140
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:21,588
She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many sheep and oxen on her account and had drunk so many casks of wine.

141
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:27,137
Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered and how much trouble he had himself given to other people.

142
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:34,130
He told her everything and she was so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till he had ended his whole story.

143
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,315
He began with his victory over the Seacons,

144
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:40,618
and how he thence reached the fertile land of the lotus eaters.

145
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:51,608
He told her all about the Cyclops, and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave comrades, how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and furthered him on his way.

146
00:14:52,308 --> 00:15:05,580
But even so he was not to reach home, for to his great grief a hurricane carried him out to sea again, how he went on to the Laestrygonian city Telepolis, where the people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only.

147
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:18,658
Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed to the chill house of Hades to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Tererias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms and his mother who bore him and brought him up when he was a child.

148
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:27,754
he then heard the wondrous singing of the sirens, and went on to the wandering rocks and terrible Charybdis, and to Scylla, whom no man had ever yet passed in safety.

149
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:37,525
How his men then ate the cavil of the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alone being left alive.

150
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:43,431
How at last he reached the Aegean island, and the nymph Calypso, who kept him there in a cave and fed him,

151
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:52,543
and wanted him to marry her, in which case this was the last thing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows.

152
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:55,467
Then Minerva bethought her of another matter.

153
00:15:55,907 --> 00:16:04,879
When she deemed that Ulysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade golden-thrown dawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind.

154
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:20,689
On this Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope, Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you here in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home, though I was longing all the time to do so.

155
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:26,901
Now, however, that we have at last come together, take care of the property that is in the house.

156
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:38,260
As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take many myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to make good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards.

157
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:48,957
I am now going to the wooded lands out in the country to see my father who has so long been grieved on my account, and to yourself I will give these instructions, though you have little need of them.

158
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:52,421
At sunrise it will at once get abroad, that I have been killing the suitors.

159
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:56,746
Go upstairs therefore, one hundred and eighty-four, and stay there with your women.

160
00:16:57,287 --> 00:17:00,290
See nobody and ask no questions."

161
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,550
185.

162
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:03,634
As he spoke, he girded on his armour.

163
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:09,701
Then he roused Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour also.

164
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:12,064
This they did, and armed themselves.

165
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:17,610
When they had done so, they opened the gates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way.

166
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:23,500
It was now daylight, but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led them quickly out of the town.
