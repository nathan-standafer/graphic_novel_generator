00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:09,690
Chapter 10 - A Bosom Friend. Returning to the Spouter Inn from the chapel I found Queequeg there quite alone, he having left the chapel before the benediction sometime.

2
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:26,393
He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his, peering hard into its face, and with a jackknife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.

3
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:48,027
But being now interrupted, he put up the image, and pretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap, began counting the pages with deliberate regularity, at every fiftieth page, as I fancied, stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn, gurgling whistle of astonishment.

4
00:00:48,007 --> 00:01:03,332
He would then begin again at the next fifty, seeming to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.

5
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:11,321
With much interest I sat watching him, savage though he was, and hideously marred about the face, at least to my taste.

6
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:15,832
His countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable.

7
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,739
You cannot hide the soul.

8
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:31,162
Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart, and in his large deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.

9
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:38,736
And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim.

10
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,764
He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor.

11
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:59,585
Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide, but certain it was, his head was phrenologically an excellent one.

12
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:07,575
It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular busts of him.

13
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:17,005
It had the same long, regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top.

14
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:21,413
Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.

15
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:35,770
Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance, but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.

16
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:48,143
Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference of his very strange.

17
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,126
But savages are strange beings.

18
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,891
At times you do not know exactly how to take them.

19
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:55,355
At first they are overawing.

20
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:59,282
Their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom.

21
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:06,474
I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn.

22
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:12,865
He made no advances whatever, appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.

23
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,817
All this struck me as mighty singular, yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.

24
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:39,662
Kyr was a man some 20,000 miles from home, by the way, of Cape Horn, that is, which was the only way he could get there, thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter, and yet he seemed entirely at his ease, preserving the utmost serenity, content with his own companionship, always equal to himself.

25
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:45,450
Surely, this was a touch of fine philosophy, though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.

26
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:51,799
But perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving.

27
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:01,954
So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have broken his digester.

28
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:12,215
As I sat there in that now lonely room, the fire burning low, in that mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only glows to be looked at.

29
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:22,896
The evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements and peering in upon us, silent solitary twain, the storm booming without in solemn swells.

30
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:25,100
I began to be sensible of strange feelings.

31
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:27,143
I felt a melting in me.

32
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:31,911
No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world.

33
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:34,455
This soothing savage had redeemed it.

34
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:41,146
There he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits.

35
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:48,799
Wild he was, a very sight of sights to see, yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.

36
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:53,870
And those same things that would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me.

37
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,522
I'll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.

38
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:06,197
I drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile.

39
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:14,951
At first he little noticed these advances, but presently, upon my referring to his last night's hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows.

40
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:19,899
I told him yes, whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.

41
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:27,932
We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it.

42
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:35,575
Thus I soon engaged his interest, and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town.

43
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:42,327
Soon I proposed a social smoke, and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.

44
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:48,685
and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly passing between us.

45
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:58,527
If there yet lurt any ice of indifference towards me in the pagan's breast, this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies.

46
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:12,981
He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him, and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married, meaning, in his country's phrase, that we were bosom friends.

47
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,744
He would gladly die for me, if need should be.

48
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:22,790
In a country man, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted.

49
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:27,535
But in this simple savage, those old rules would not apply.

50
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,125
After supper and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room together.

51
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:50,687
He made me a present of his embalmed head, took out his enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in silver, then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine.

52
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:55,851
I was going to remonstrate, but he silenced me by pouring them into my trousers' pockets.

53
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:57,353
I let them stay.

54
00:06:57,373 --> 00:07:02,877
He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper fireboard.

55
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:14,367
By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him, but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.

56
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:20,252
I was a good Christian, born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church.

57
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:25,280
How then could I unite with this wild idolater in worshiping his piece of wood?

58
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:27,743
But what is worship, thought I?

59
00:07:28,504 --> 00:07:38,454
Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth, pagans and all included, can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood?

60
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:39,816
Impossible!

61
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:42,219
But what is worship?

62
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,500
To do the will of God?

63
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,223
That is worship.

64
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:47,665
And what is the will of God?

65
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:52,031
To do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me.

66
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:54,174
That is the will of God.

67
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:56,557
Now, Queequeg is my fellow man.

68
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:59,361
And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?

69
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:03,867
Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.

70
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:09,274
Consequently, I must then unite with him in his, ergo I must turn idolater.

71
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:25,271
So I kindled the shavings, helped prop up the innocent little idol, offered him burnt biscuit with kwee kweg, salamed before him twice or thrice, kissed his nose, and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.

72
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:28,714
But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.

73
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:35,481
How it is I know not, but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends.

74
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:44,455
Man and wife, they say, they're open the very bottom of their souls to each other, and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.

75
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:50,989
Thus then, in our heart's honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg, a cozy, loving pair.
