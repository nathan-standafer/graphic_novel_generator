Chapter 10 A Bosom Friend

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:11,383
Returning to the spouder-in from the chapel, I found Queequeg there, quite alone, having left the chapel before the benediction some time.

3
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:32,485
He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.

4
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:45,341
But, being now interrupted, he put up the image, and pretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, and, placing it on his lap, began counting the pages with deliberate regularity.

5
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:57,055
At every fiftieth page's eye fancied stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn, gurgling whistle of astonishment.

6
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:06,367
He would then begin again at the next fifty, seeming to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty.

7
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:15,578
And it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.

8
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,722
With much interest I sat watching him.

9
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:28,913
Savage though he was, and hideously marred about the face at least to my taste's countenance, yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable.

10
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,817
You cannot hide the soul.

11
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:46,633
Through all his unearthly tattooings I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart, and in his large deep eyes, fiery, black, and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.

12
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:55,125
And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim.

13
00:01:56,286 --> 00:02:01,113
He looked like a man who had never cringed, and never had had a creditor.

14
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:11,828
Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would,

15
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:18,969
This I will not venture to decide, but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one.

16
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:26,070
It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular busts of him.

17
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:38,373
It had the same long, regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top.

18
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:51,289
Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed, whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half pretending, meanwhile, to be looking out at the storm from the casement.

19
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:52,851
He never heeded my presence.

20
00:02:52,831 --> 00:03:02,048
Never troubled himself with so much as a single glance, but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.

21
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:14,552
Considering how so subtly we had been sleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning,

22
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:17,876
I thought this indifference of his very strange.

23
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:20,038
But savages are strange beings.

24
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:22,921
At times you do not know exactly how to take them.

25
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:30,549
At first they are overawing inâ€”the real self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom.

26
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:39,038
I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn.

27
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:45,406
He made no advances, whatever appeared, to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.

28
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:53,636
All this struck me as mighty singular, yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.

29
00:03:53,716 --> 00:04:07,033
Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is, which was the only way he could get their throne among people, as strange to him, as though he were in planet Jupiter.

30
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:17,972
and yet he seemed entirely at his ease, preserving the utmost serenity, content with his own companionship, whereas all was equal to himself.

31
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:24,983
Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy, though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.

32
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:28,870
But, perhaps, to be true philosophers,

33
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,359
We mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving.

34
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:44,783
So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have broken his digester.

35
00:04:44,763 --> 00:05:09,707
As I sat there in that now lonely room, the fire burning low, in that mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only glows to be looked at, the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements, and peering in upon a silent solitary twain, the storm without insolent swells I began to be sensible of strange feelings.

36
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:11,910
Smith, I felt a melting in me.

37
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,537
No more my splendid heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world.

38
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,520
This soothing savage had redeemed it.

39
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:29,411
There he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurped no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits.

40
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:36,960
Wild he was a very sight of sights to see, yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.

41
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,272
And, those same things that would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me.

42
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:50,643
"'I'll try a pagan friend,' thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.

43
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:58,617
I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile.

44
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:02,323
At first he little noticed these advances,

45
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:10,554
But presently, upon my referring to his last night's hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows.

46
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:17,283
I told him yes, whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.

47
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:28,058
We then turned over the book together, and I endeavoured to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it.

48
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:36,713
Thus I soon engaged his interest, and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town.

49
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:39,698
Soon I proposed a social smoke.

50
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,709
On, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.

51
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:53,141
And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly passing between us.

52
00:06:54,242 --> 00:07:04,018
If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagan's breast, this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies.

53
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:09,807
He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him.

54
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:23,340
And when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married, meaning, in his country's phrase, that we were bosom friends.

55
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,823
He would gladly die for me, if need should be.

56
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:34,290
In a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted.

57
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,034
But in this simple savage those old rules would not apply.

58
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:45,285
After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room together.

59
00:07:45,385 --> 00:08:06,473
He made me a present of his embalmed head, took out his enormous tobacco wallet, and, groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in silver, then spreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and said it was mine.

60
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:12,500
I was going to remonstrate, but he silenced me by pouring them into my trousers' pockets.

61
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:14,062
I let them stay.

62
00:08:14,122 --> 00:08:20,570
He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper fireboard.

63
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:35,008
By certain signs and symptoms I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him, but, well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.

64
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:40,559
I was a good Christian, born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church.

65
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,325
How, then, could I unite with this wild idolater in worshipping his piece of wood?

66
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:47,927
But what is worship?

67
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:59,599
thought I. Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth pagans, and all included, can, possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood?

68
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,161
Impossible.

69
00:09:01,902 --> 00:09:02,883
But what is worship?

70
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,945
To do the will of God.

71
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,253
that is worship.

72
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:07,715
And what is the will of God?

73
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:14,544
To do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me, that is the will of God.

74
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:21,033
Now Queequeg is my fellow man, and what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?

75
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:25,819
Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.

76
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:30,966
Consequently, I must then unite with him in his, ergo, I must turn it all

77
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:47,762
So I kindled the shavings, helped prop up the innocent little idol, offered him burnt biscuit with kwee-kweg, saw him before him twice or thrice, kissed his nose, and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences.

78
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:51,005
But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.

79
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:58,793
How it is, I know not, but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends.

80
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:08,426
Man and wife, they say, there open the very bottom Of their souls to each other, and some old couples Often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.

81
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:15,651
Thus, then, in our heart's honeymoon, Lay I and Cui-keg Ah-kwe-zee, loving pair.
