00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:14,209
Chapter 124 - The Needle. Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long, slow billows of mighty bulk, and, striving in the Pequod's gurgling track, pushed her on like giants' palms outspread.

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:21,398
The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky and air seemed vast, outbellying sails.

3
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:24,402
The whole world boomed before the wind.

4
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:32,781
Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place, where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks.

5
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:38,293
Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything.

6
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:43,926
The sea was as a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.

7
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:55,364
Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart, and every time the tethering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye the bright sun's rays produced ahead.

8
00:00:56,186 --> 00:01:06,522
And when she profoundly settled by the stern, he turned behind and saw the sun's rearward place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.

9
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:07,844
Ha, ha, my ship!

10
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:11,690
Thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of the sun.

11
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:12,852
Ho, ho!

12
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:17,178
All ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye.

13
00:01:17,198 --> 00:01:20,143
Yoke on the further billows, hallo!

14
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,606
A tandem, I drive the sea.

15
00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:30,298
But suddenly reigned back by some counter-thought, he hurried towards the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.

16
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,635
"'East, sir,' said the frightened steersman.

17
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:38,061
"'Thou liest,' smiting him with his clenched fist.

18
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:41,667
"'Heading east at this hour in the morning, and the sun is stern?'

19
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:49,861
Upon this every soul was confounded, for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped everyone else.

20
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:54,008
But its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause.

21
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:59,270
Thrusting his head halfway into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses.

22
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:01,533
His uplifted arms slowly fell.

23
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:04,276
For a moment he almost seemed to stagger.

24
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:07,720
Standing behind him, Starbuck looked, and lo!

25
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,066
The two compasses pointed east, and the Pequod was as infallibly going west.

26
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:21,056
But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, I have it!

27
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,218
It has happened before!

28
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:27,424
Mr. Starbuck, last night's thunder turned our compasses, that's all.

29
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:30,729
Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.

30
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:36,378
Ay, but never before has it happened to me, sir," said the pale mate gloomily.

31
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:37,479
Gloomily.

32
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:45,291
Here it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms.

33
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:53,738
The magnetic energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all know, essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven.

34
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:57,844
Hence it is not to be much marveled at, that such things should be.

35
00:02:57,884 --> 00:03:05,035
Instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging,

36
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:16,270
The effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal, all its lodestone virtue being annihilated, so that the before-magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife's knitting needle.

37
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:33,874
But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost, and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship, even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.

38
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:51,492
Deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun and, satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship's course to be changed accordingly.

39
00:03:51,472 --> 00:04:00,708
The yards were hard up, and once more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her.

40
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:15,252
Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders, while Stub and Flask, who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings, likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced.

41
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:20,966
As for the men, though some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of fate.

42
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:33,375
But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed, or if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahabs.

43
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:36,944
For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries.

44
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:45,390
But, chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper sight tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.

45
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:49,077
Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot.

46
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:54,163
Yesterday I wrecked thee, and today the compasses would fain have wrecked me.

47
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:55,445
So, so.

48
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:58,949
But Ahab is lord over the level lodestone yet.

49
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:06,298
Mr. Starbuck, a lance without a pole, a top maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker's needles.

50
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:22,240
Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses.

51
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:34,817
Besides, the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portents.

52
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:35,257
"'Men!'

53
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:39,942
said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him the things he had demanded.

54
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:41,003
"'My men!'

55
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:43,646
The thunder turned old Ahab's needles.

56
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:49,071
"'But out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point as true as any.'

57
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:58,160
A bashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this was said, and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow.

58
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,282
But Starbuck looked away.

59
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:10,832
With a blow from the top maul, Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him hold it upright without its touching the deck.

60
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:24,514
Then, with the maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before.

61
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:27,197
then going through some small strange motions with it.

62
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:34,665
Whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain.

63
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:45,197
He called for linen thread, and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reverse needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail needle by its middle, over one of the compass cards.

64
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:51,244
At first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either end.

65
00:06:51,494 --> 00:07:10,448
But at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed, Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level lodestone, the sun is east and that compass swears it.

66
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:18,682
One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away.

67
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:25,534
In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his fatal pride.
