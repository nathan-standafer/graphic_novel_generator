Chapter 83 - Jonah Historically Regarded

2
00:00:01,934 --> 00:00:09,007
Chapter 83 - Jonah Historically Regarded. Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter.

3
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:13,875
Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale.

4
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:25,195
But then there were some skeptical Greeks and Romans who, standing out from the Orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arian and the dolphin.

5
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:30,460
And yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one with the less facts, for all that.

6
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:35,726
One old Sag Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this.

7
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:53,123
He had one of those quaint, old-fashioned Bibles, embellished with curious, unscientific plates, one of which represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head, a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan, the right whale, and the varieties of that order,

8
00:00:53,103 --> 00:01:01,491
concerning which the fishermen have this saying, a penny roll would choke him, his swallow is so very small, his swallow is so very small.

9
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:06,136
But, to this, Bishop Jeb's anticipative answer is ready.

10
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:15,104
It is not necessary, hints the bishop, that we consider Jonah as tuned in the whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth.

11
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:18,908
And this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop.

12
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:24,620
For truly, the right whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of whistables and comfortably seat all the players.

13
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:32,576
Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth, but, on second thoughts, the right whale is toothless.

14
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:40,052
Another reason which Sag Harbor, he went by that name, urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet,

15
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:45,465
with something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices.

16
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:55,510
But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale.

17
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,436
even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents and crawled into them.

18
00:02:02,076 --> 00:02:23,978
Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to another vessel nearby, some vessel with a whale for a figurehead, and, I would add, possibly called the whale, as some craft are nowadays christened the shark, the gull, the eagle,

19
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:37,993
Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the Book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver, an inflated bag of wind which the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom.

20
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:41,918
Poor Sag Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round.

21
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:45,101
But he had still another reason for his want of faith.

22
00:02:45,702 --> 00:02:46,843
It was this.

23
00:02:46,823 --> 00:03:03,200
If I remember right, Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days' journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast.

24
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:04,301
How is that?

25
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:09,387
But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh?

26
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:14,552
Yes, he might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope,

27
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:21,808
but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea.

28
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:34,296
Such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris waters near the site of Nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in.

29
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:47,005
Besides, this idea of Jonah's weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would rest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history a liar.

30
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:52,217
But all these foolish arguments of old Sag Harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason.

31
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:58,948
a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea.

32
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:05,840
I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride and abominable, devilish rebellion against the Reverend Clergy.

33
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:16,838
For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah's going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle.

34
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:17,739
And so it was.

35
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:24,510
Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah.

36
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:37,189
And some three centuries ago, an English traveler in old Harris's voyages speaks of a Turkish mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.
