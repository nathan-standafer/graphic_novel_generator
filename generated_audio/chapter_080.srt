00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:11,205
Chapter 80 - The Nut. If the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx, to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.

2
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:14,976
In the full-grown creature, the skull will measure at least 20 feet in length.

3
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:22,665
Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base.

4
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:33,379
But in life, as we have elsewhere seen, this inclined plane is angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm.

5
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:39,696
At the high end, the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass, while under the long floor of this crater.

6
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:47,723
In another cavity seldom exceeding 10 inches in length, and as many in depth, reposes the mere handful of this monster's brain.

7
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:51,647
The brain is at least 20 feet from his apparent forehead in life.

8
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:59,755
It is hidden away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec.

9
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:17,742
So like a choice casket is it secreted in him that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic yards of his sperm magazine, lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions to their apprehensions.

10
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:25,472
It seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.

11
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:32,984
It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the creature's living intact state, is an entire delusion.

12
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:37,812
As for his true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any.

13
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:43,461
The whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.

14
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:56,853
If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation and from the same point of view.

15
00:01:56,913 --> 00:02:12,908
Indeed, place this reverse skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of men's skulls, and you would involuntarily confound it with them, and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say,

16
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:30,610
This man had no self-esteem and no veneration, and by those negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.

17
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:39,284
But if, from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain, you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea for you.

18
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:51,906
If you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper.

19
00:02:52,004 --> 00:03:02,218
It is a German conceit that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls, but the curious external resemblance I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive.

20
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:14,535
A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relevo, the beaked prow of his canoe.

21
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:23,729
Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal.

22
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,954
For I believe that much of a man's character will be found betokened in his backbone.

23
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:33,077
I would rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are.

24
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:38,021
A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.

25
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:45,568
I rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world.

26
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:48,812
Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale.

27
00:03:49,293 --> 00:04:01,474
His cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck vertebra, and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure 10 inches across, being 8 in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards.

28
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:09,868
As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity.

29
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:20,485
Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance, the spinal cord, as the brain, and directly communicates with the brain.

30
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:31,418
And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.

31
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:38,361
Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale's spine phrenologically?

32
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:48,638
For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord.

33
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:57,793
But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the sperm whale's hump.

34
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:06,969
This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it.

35
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:14,963
From its relative situation, then, I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm-whale.

36
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:20,372
And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.
