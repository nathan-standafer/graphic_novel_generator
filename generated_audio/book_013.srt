1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,903
Book 13 Ulysses leaves Syria and returns to Adhaka.

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:13,112
Thus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous began to speak.

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:20,920
Ulysses, said he, now that you have reached my house, I doubt not you will get home without further misadventure, no matter how much you have suffered in the past.

4
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:28,811
To you others, however, who come here night after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard, I would insist as follows.

5
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:35,960
Our guest has already packed up the clothes, wrought gold, thousand and eight, and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance.

6
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:41,968
Let us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us with a large tripod and a cauldron.

7
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:49,359
We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a general rate, for private individuals cannot be expected to bear the burden of such a handsome present."

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,966
Everyone approved of this, and then they went home to bed, each in his own abode.

9
00:00:54,827 --> 00:01:00,776
When the Child of Morning, Rosy-Fingered Dawn, appeared, they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them.

10
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:09,289
Alcinous went on board and saw everything so securely stowed under the ship's benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers.

11
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:15,721
Then they went to the house of Alcinus to get dinner, and he sacrificed a bull for them in honor of Jove who is the Lord of all.

12
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:23,756
They set the steaks to grill and made an excellent dinner, after which the inspired bard Demodocus, who was a favorite with everyone, sang to them.

13
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:31,210
But Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as though to hasten his setting, for he was longing to be on his way.

14
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:41,542
as one who has been all day plowing a fallow field with a couple of oxen, keeps thinking about his supper, and is glad when night comes that he may go and get it, for it is all his legs can do to carry him.

15
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:52,675
Even so did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down, and he at once said to the Phaeacians, addressing himself more particularly to King Alcinous, Sir, and all of you, farewell.

16
00:01:52,655 --> 00:02:06,821
Make your drink offerings, and send me on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire by giving me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may turn to good account, may I find my admirable wife living in peace among friends.

17
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:08,303
1009.

18
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:13,212
And may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction to your wives and children.

19
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:19,001
A hundred and ten may heaven vouchsafe you every good grace, and may no evil thing come among your people."

20
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:20,683
Thus did he speak.

21
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:27,052
His hearers all of them approved his saying, and agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably.

22
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:37,748
Alcinus therefore said to his servant, Pontinus, mix some wine and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer to Father Jove, and speed our guest upon his way.

23
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,735
Pontinus mixed the wine and handed it to everyone in turn.

24
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:45,083
The others, each from his own seat, made a drink offering to the blessed gods that live in heaven.

25
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:49,171
But Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands of Queen Aretha.

26
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:51,315
Farewell, Queen, said he.

27
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:57,947
Henceforward and forever, till age and death, the common lot of mankind lay their hands upon you.

28
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,169
I now take my leave.

29
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,577
Be happy in this house with your children, your people, and with King Alcinus."

30
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:10,209
As he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinus sent a man to conduct him to his ship and to the seashore.

31
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,598
Arate also sent some maidservants with him, one with a clean shirt and cloak,

32
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:19,323
another to carry his strongbox, and a third with corn and wine.

33
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:30,779
When they got to the waterside the crew took these things and put them on board with all the meat and drink, but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship.

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:40,692
Then he too went on board and lay down without a word, but the crew took every man his place and loosed the horser from the pierced stone to which it had been bound.

35
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:47,051
Thereon, when they began rowing out to sea, Ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, and almost death-like slumber.

36
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:48,315
1-1-1.

37
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:54,934
The ship bounded forward on her way as a four-in-hand chariot flies over the course when the horses feel the whip.

38
00:03:55,488 --> 00:04:01,535
Her prow corvetted as it were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water seethed in her wake.

39
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:07,502
She held steadily on her course, and even a falcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her.

40
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:21,057
Thus, then, she cut her way through the water, carrying one who was as cunning as the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of all that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea.

41
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:26,483
When the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show, the ship drew near to land 1111.

42
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:35,033
Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the old Merman forces, which lies between two points that break the line of the sea and shut the harbour in.

43
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:42,522
These shelter it from the storms of wind and sea that rage outside, so that when once within it a ship may lie without being even moored.

44
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:51,718
At the head of this harbour there is a large olive tree, and at no great distance a fine overarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are called Nyads 113.

45
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,107
There are mixing bowls within it and wine jars of stone, and the bees hive there.

46
00:04:57,628 --> 00:05:06,062
Moreover, there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes of sea-purple, very curious to see, and at all times there is water within it.

47
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:14,280
It has two entrances, one facing north by which mortals can go down into the cave, while the other comes from the south and is more mysterious.

48
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:18,530
Mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the way taken by the gods.

49
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:24,102
Into this harbor then, they took their ship, for they knew the place 114.

50
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:28,409
She had so much weigh upon her that she ran half her own length onto the shore.

51
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:39,728
One-fifteen, when, however, they had landed, the first thing they did was to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the ship and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep.

52
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:45,659
Then they took out the presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him when he was setting out on his voyage homewards.

53
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:57,801
They put these all together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear some passer-by 116 might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke, and then they made the best of their way home again.

54
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:03,171
But Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already threatened Ulysses, so he took counsel with Jove.

55
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:13,550
Father Jove, said he, I shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods if mortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show such small regard for me.

56
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:17,477
I said I would let Ulysses get home when he had suffered sufficiently.

57
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:38,390
I did not say that he should never get home at all, for I knew you had already nodded your head about it and promised that he should do so, but now they have brought him in a ship fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him with more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he would ever have brought back from Troy if he had had his share of the spoil and got home without misadventure."

58
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:43,819
And Jove answered, "'What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking about?'

59
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,564
The gods are by no means wanting and respect for you.

60
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:51,192
It would be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honored as you are.

61
00:06:51,973 --> 00:07:03,192
As regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence and treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself to deal with him as you may think proper, so do just as you please.

62
00:07:03,543 --> 00:07:05,828
I should have done so at once," replied Neptune.

63
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:14,567
If I were not anxious to avoid anything that might displease you, now, therefore, I should like to wreck the Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its escort.

64
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:22,024
This will stop them from escorting people in future, and I should also like to bury their city under a huge mountain.

65
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:32,393
My good friend, answered Jove, I should recommend you at the very moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way, to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship.

66
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:37,347
This will astonish everybody and you can then bury their city under the mountain.

67
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:45,774
When Earth-encircling Neptune heard this, he went to Sheria, where the Phaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid way, had got close in.

68
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:51,859
Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground.

69
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,801
After this he went away.

70
00:07:53,821 --> 00:08:04,070
The Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn towards his neighbor, saying, Bless my heart, who is it that can have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port?

71
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,692
We could see the whole of her only a moment ago.

72
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:13,396
This was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it, and Alcinius said, I remember now the old prophecy of my father.

73
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:24,609
He said that Neptune would be angry with us for taking everyone so safely over the sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain.

74
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,756
This was what my old father used to say, and now it is all coming true 1.1.17.

75
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:32,758
Now, therefore, let us all do as I say.

76
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:45,074
In the first place, we must leave off giving people escorts when they come here, and in the next, let us sacrifice twelve picked bulls to Neptune, that he may have mercy upon us, and not bury our city under the high mountain."

77
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:47,717
When the people heard this, they were afraid and got ready the bulls.

78
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:58,330
Thus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians pray to King Neptune, standing round his altar, and at the same time Olonatine Ulysses woke up once more upon his own soil.

79
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,912
He had been so long away that he did not know it again.

80
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:15,986
Moreover, Jove's daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so that people might not know of his having come, and that she might tell him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and friends recognizing him 119 until he had taken his revenge upon the wicked suitors.

81
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,929
Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him.

82
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:28,317
The long, straight tracks, the harbors, the precipices, and the goodly trees appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native land.

83
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:32,582
So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried aloud despairingly.

84
00:09:32,602 --> 00:09:37,188
Alas, he exclaimed, among what manner of people am I fallen?

85
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:41,133
Are they savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane?

86
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:44,858
Where shall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go?

87
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:52,127
I wish I had stayed over there with the Phaeacians, or I could have gone to some other great chief who would have been good to me and given me an escort.

88
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:58,135
As it is, I do not know where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it.

89
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:04,566
In good truth, the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by me and have left me in the wrong country.

90
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,951
They said they would take me back to Ithaca, and they have not done so.

91
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:14,101
May Jove, the protector of suppliants, chastise them, for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong.

92
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:18,368
Still, I suppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of them.

93
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:23,956
He counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his clothes, but there was nothing missing.

94
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:31,247
Still he kept grieving about not being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore of the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate.

95
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:38,598
Then Minerva came up to him disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a good cloak folded double about her shoulders.

96
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,364
She had sandals on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand.

97
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:45,049
Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and went straight up to her.

98
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:49,879
"'My friend,' said he, "'you are the first person whom I have met with in this country.

99
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,947
I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be well disposed towards me.

100
00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:00,741
Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your knees and pray to you as though you were a god.'"

101
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:06,528
Tell me then, and tell me truly, what land and country is this, who are its inhabitants?

102
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,070
Am I on an island?

103
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:10,653
Or is this the seaboard of some continent?"

104
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:11,754
Minerva answered.

105
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:18,403
Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this is.

106
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:22,628
It is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it, east and west.

107
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:28,635
It is rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no means a bad island for what there is of it.

108
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:34,047
It grows any quantity of corn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew.

109
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,693
It breeds cattle also, and goats.

110
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:48,379
All kinds of timber grow here, and there are watering places where the water never runs dry, so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand to be a long way off from this Achaean country.

111
00:11:49,760 --> 00:12:00,059
Ulysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own country, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.

112
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,853
I heard of Ithaca, said he, when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures.

113
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:15,584
I have left as much more behind me from my children, but am flying because I killed Orsolochus son of Idomenus, the fleetest runner in Crete.

114
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:21,313
I killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy with so much trouble and danger.

115
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:30,926
Both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea, he said I had not served his father loyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an independent ruler.

116
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:37,536
So I lay in wait for him with one of my followers by the roadside and speared him as he was coming into town from the country.

117
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,900
It was a very dark night, and nobody saw us.

118
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:42,445
It was not known, therefore, that I had killed him.

119
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:53,666
But as soon as I had done so, I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were Phoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos, or in Elis, where the Epians rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them.

120
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:59,777
They meant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither by night.

121
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:08,867
It was all we could do to get inside the harbor, and none of us said a word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were.

122
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:16,659
I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my goods out of the ship and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the sand.

123
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,546
Then they sailed away to Cydonia, and I was left here in great distress of mind.

124
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:25,092
Such was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand.

125
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,878
Then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise.

126
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:36,790
He must be indeed a shifty lying fellow, said she, who could surpass you in all manner of craft, even though you had a god for your antagonist.

127
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:46,285
Daredevil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are in your own country again?

128
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:51,177
We will say no more, however, about this, for we can both of us deceive upon occasion.

129
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:59,251
You are the most accomplished counselor and orator among all mankind, while I for diplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods.

130
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:08,847
Did you not know Jove's daughter Minerva me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch over you in all your troubles, and who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you?

131
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:15,433
And now, again, I am come here to talk things over with you and help you to hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you.

132
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:19,137
I want to tell you about the troubles that await you in your own house.

133
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:24,281
You have got to face them, but tell no one, neither man nor woman, that you have come home again.

134
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:28,585
Bear everything, and put up with every man's insolence without a word.'

135
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:36,673
And Ulysses answered, A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you,

136
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:39,497
It is a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not.

137
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:42,482
This much, however, I know exceedingly well.

138
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:52,818
You were very kind to me as long as we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day on which we went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam and heaven dispersed us.

139
00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:00,450
From that day, Minerva, I saw no more of you and cannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a difficulty.

140
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:08,888
I had to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil, and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took me into the town.

141
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:17,403
And now I beseech you in your father's name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in Ithaca.

142
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:22,448
I am in some other country, and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you have been saying.

143
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:26,433
Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own country?"

144
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:34,061
You are always taking something of that sort in your head," replied Minerva, and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions.

145
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:37,204
You are so plausible, shrewd, and shifty.

146
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:43,135
Anyone but yourself on returning from so long a voyage would at once have gone home to see his wife and children.

147
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:56,458
But you do not seem to care about asking after them, or hearing any news about them, till you have exploited your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having no peace night or day for the tears she sheds on your behalf.

148
00:15:56,523 --> 00:16:08,997
As for my not coming near you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back safely, though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with my uncle Neptune, who never forgave you for having blinded his son.

149
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,424
Night 21, I will now, however, point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhaps believe me.

150
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:22,312
This is the haven of the old Merman forces, and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of it.

151
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:25,777
Near it is the cave sacred to the Nyads, 122.

152
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:34,410
Here, too, is the overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable hecatomb to the nymphs, and this is the Wooded Mountain, Neritum.

153
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:37,964
As she spoke, the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared.

154
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:43,811
Then Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land and kissed the bounteous soil.

155
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:51,619
He lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs, saying, "'Nyadnymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never again to see you.

156
00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:01,410
Now, therefore, I greet you with all loving salutations, and I will bring you offerings, as in the old days, if Jove's redoubtable daughter will grant me life and bring my son to manhood.

157
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:05,246
Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that," rejoined Minerva.

158
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:09,731
Let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where they will be quite safe.

159
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:11,994
Let us see how we can best manage it all.

160
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:22,266
Therewith, she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding places, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and good clothing which the Phaeacians had given him.

161
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:27,853
They stowed everything carefully away, and Minerva set a stone against the door of the cave.

162
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:33,840
Then the two sat down by the root of the great olive and consulted how to compass the destruction of the wicked suitors.

163
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:53,605
Ulysses, said Minerva, noble son of Laertes, think how you can lay hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in your house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding presents to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving hope and sending encouraging messages twelve-three to every one of them, but meaning the very opposite of all she says.

164
00:17:53,585 --> 00:18:05,506
And Ulysses answered, In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have come to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you had not given me such timely information did, if you had not given me such timely information.

165
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:08,691
Advise me how I shall best avenge myself.

166
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:15,161
Stand by my side and put your courage into my heart, as on the day when we loosed Troy's fair diadem from her brow.

167
00:18:15,842 --> 00:18:20,850
Help me now as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men if you, goddess, will be with me."

168
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,953
"'Trust me for that,' said she.

169
00:18:22,973 --> 00:18:32,147
"'I will not lose sight of you when once we set about it, and I imagine that some of those who are devouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their blood and brains.'"

170
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:36,039
I will begin by disguising you so that no human being shall know you.

171
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,003
I will cover your body with wrinkles.

172
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:39,887
You shall lose all your yellow hair.

173
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:43,555
I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see it with loathing.

174
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:51,351
I will blear your fine eyes for you and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of your wife and of the son whom you left behind you.

175
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:54,743
Then go at once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs.

176
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:59,510
He has been always well-affected towards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son.

177
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:09,424
You will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is called Raven 24 by the fountain Arathusa, where they are fattening on beachmast and spring water after their manor.

178
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:19,082
Stay with him and find out how things are going, while I proceed to Sparta and see your son who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try and find out whether you are still alive."

179
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:24,612
"'Twenty-five, but why,' said Ulysses, "'did you not tell him, for you knew all about it?'

180
00:19:24,592 --> 00:19:29,981
Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate?"

181
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:33,005
Minerva answered, Never mind about him.

182
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:36,030
I sent him that he might be well spoken of for having gone.

183
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:43,542
He is in no sort of difficulty, but is staying quite comfortably with Menelaus and is surrounded with abundance of every kind.

184
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:49,772
The suitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home.

185
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:57,039
do not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those who are now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves."

186
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:06,149
As she spoke, Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over his whole body.

187
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,332
She glared his eyes, which were naturally very fine ones.

188
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:13,397
She changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him,

189
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:16,463
and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke.

190
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:25,281
She also gave him an undressed deerskin as an outer garment, and furnished him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for him to sling it over his shoulder.

191
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:31,875
When the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted, and the goddess went straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.
