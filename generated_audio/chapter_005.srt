00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:08,290
Chapter 5 - Breakfast. I quickly followed suit, and descending into the barroom accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:15,306
I cherished no malice towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow.

3
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:21,205
However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good thing, the more is the pity.

4
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:33,683
So, if any one man, in his own proper person, affords stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way.

5
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:41,935
And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.

6
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:48,439
The barroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.

7
00:00:49,139 --> 00:01:06,881
They were nearly all whalemen, chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea copers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooners, and shipkeepers, a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards, an unshorn shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.

8
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:11,466
You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.

9
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:17,492
This young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky.

10
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:20,696
He cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage.

11
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:23,559
That man next him looks a few shades lighter.

12
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,201
You might say a touch of satin wood is in him.

13
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:31,707
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached with all.

14
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:32,748
H.E.

15
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:35,631
doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.

16
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:46,847
But who could show a cheek like Queequeg, which, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes' western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates zone by zone?

17
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:48,209
Grub-ho!

18
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:52,635
now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went to breakfast.

19
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:59,965
They say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.

20
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:22,948
Not always, though, Ledyard, the great New England traveler, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one, of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor, but perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's performances,

21
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:28,678
This kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish.

22
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,310
Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.

23
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:46,587
These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling, to my no small surprise, nearly every man maintained a profound silence.

24
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:50,473
And not only that, but they looked embarrassed.

25
00:02:50,493 --> 00:03:01,609
Yes, here were a set of sea dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas, entire strangers to them, and dueled them dead without winking.

26
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:13,725
And yet here they sat at a social breakfast table, all of the same calling, all of kindred tastes, looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains.

27
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:20,374
A curious sight, these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen.

28
00:03:20,354 --> 00:03:24,441
But as for Queequeg, why, Queequeg sat there among them.

29
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:29,049
At the head of the table, too, it so chanced, as cool as an icicle.

30
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:31,953
To be sure, I cannot say much for his breeding.

31
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:46,598
His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there without ceremony, reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.

32
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:55,090
But that was certainly very coolly done by him, and everyone knows that in most people's estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it gentilly.

33
00:03:55,791 --> 00:04:05,346
We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here, how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare.

34
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:16,990
Enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when I sallied out for a stroll.
