Chapter 5 BREAKFAST

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:10,577
I quickly followed suit, and, descending into the bar-room, accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly.

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:17,506
I cherished no malice towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow.

4
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:22,913
However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good thing.

5
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:24,916
The more's the pity.

6
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:31,945
So, if any one man, in his own proper person, affords stuff for a good joke to anybody,

7
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:37,735
let him not be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way.

8
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:46,209
And a man that has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.

9
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:56,447
The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.

10
00:00:56,427 --> 00:01:16,353
They were nearly all whalemen chief-mates, and second-mates, and third-mates, and sea-carpenters, and sea-coopers, and sea-blacksmiths, and harponeers, and ship-keepers, a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards, an unshorn shaggy set, all wearing monkey-jackets for morning gowns.

11
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:20,258
You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.

12
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:28,827
This young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as musky.

13
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:32,931
He cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage.

14
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:35,714
That man next him looks a few shades lighter.

15
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:38,256
You might say a touch of satin wood is in him.

16
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:44,743
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached with awe.

17
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:51,235
H. E. Doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore, but who could show a cheek like Queequeg?

18
00:01:52,016 --> 00:02:03,036
Which, barred with various tents, seemed like the Andes' western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.

19
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:07,909
Now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went to breakfast.

20
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:15,058
They say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.

21
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:26,712
Not always, though Collediard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one, of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlour.

22
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:43,738
But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs, as Ledger did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's performances, this kind of travel, I say.

23
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:48,268
may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish.

24
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:53,159
Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.

25
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:59,854
These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table,

26
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:03,738
And I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling.

27
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:09,403
To my no small surprise, nearly every man maintained a profound silence.

28
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:13,327
Not only that, but they looked embarrassed.

29
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:26,179
Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom, without the slightest bashfulness, had boarded great whales on the high seas, entire strangers to them, and dueled them dead

30
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,141
without winking.

31
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:42,835
And yet, here they sat at a social breakfast-table all of the same coin, all of kindred tastes looking round, as sheepishly at each other, as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains.

32
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:47,442
A curious sight, these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!

33
00:03:47,983 --> 00:04:00,161
But as for Queequag Wye, Queequag sat there among them, at the head of the table, too, its so chanced, chanced, assed, cool as an icicle, to be sure I cannot say much for his breeding.

34
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:11,978
His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there, without ceremony, reaching over the table with it

35
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:17,529
to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.

36
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:28,270
But that was certainly very coolly done by him, and everyone knows that in most people's estimation to do anything coolly is to do it gently.

37
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,422
We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here, how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls,

38
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:54,942
and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare, enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.
