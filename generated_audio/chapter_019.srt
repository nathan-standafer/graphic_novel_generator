00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,972
CHAPTER XIX.

2
00:00:01,493 --> 00:00:02,054
THE PROPHET.

3
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:04,638
Shipmates, have you shipped in that ship?

4
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:17,736
Kwee Kweg and I had just left the Pequod, and were saltering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above words were put to us by a stranger.

5
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:23,383
who, pausing before us, leveled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question.

6
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:32,074
He was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trousers, a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck.

7
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:43,588
A confluent smallpox had, in all directions, flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters had been dried up.

8
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:45,010
"'Have ye shipped in her?'

9
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,991
he repeated.

10
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:54,121
"'You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,' said I, trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.

11
00:00:55,223 --> 00:01:07,298
"'Ah, the Pequod, that ship there,' he said, drawing back his whole arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,902
"'Yes,' said I.

13
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:12,085
"'We have just signed the articles.'

14
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,107
"'Anything down there about your souls?'

15
00:01:14,127 --> 00:01:16,010
"'About what?'

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,115
"'Oh, perhaps you haven't got any,' he said quickly.

17
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:23,720
"'No matter, though, I know many chaps that haven't got any.

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,082
Good luck, Twim.

19
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:27,625
And they are all the better off for it.

20
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:31,230
A soul's a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.'

21
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,332
"'What are you jabbering about, shit-mate?'

22
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:34,534
said I.

23
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:40,441
He's got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps."

24
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:48,450
Abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon the word, "'Hech, kwee-kweg,' said I. Let's go.

25
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,793
This fellow is broken loose from somewhere.

26
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:54,157
He's talking about something and somebody we don't know."

27
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:55,379
"'Stop!'

28
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,620
cried the stranger.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,162
"'He said true.

30
00:01:58,222 --> 00:02:01,686
Ye haven't seen old Thunder yet, have ye?'

31
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,088
Who's old Thunder?"

32
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:08,478
said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner, Captain Ahab.

33
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:12,365
"'What, the captain of our ship, the Pequod?'

34
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:16,852
"'Ay, among some of us old sailor-chaps he goes by that name.

35
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:18,836
Ye haven't seen him yet, have ye?'

36
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:21,100
"'No, we haven't.'

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,868
"'He's sick, they say, but is getting better, and will be all right again before long.'

38
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:32,560
"'All right again before long,' laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh.

39
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,063
"'Look ye, Captain Ahab is all right.

40
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:39,066
Then this left arm of mine will be all right.

41
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:40,507
Not before.

42
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,969
What do you know about him?'

43
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,172
"'What did they tell you about him?

44
00:02:45,452 --> 00:02:46,053
Say that.'

45
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:54,100
"'They didn't tell much of anything about him, only I have heard that he's a good whale-hunter and a good captain to his crew.'

46
00:02:55,733 --> 00:03:01,139
That's true, that's true, yes, both true enough, but you must jump when he gives an order.

47
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:14,193
Step and growl, growl and go, that's the word with Captain Ahab, but nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights.

48
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:20,139
Nothing about that deadly scrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa.

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,602
Heard nothing about that, eh?"

50
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:31,139
Nothing about the silver calabash he sped into, and nothing about his losing his leg last voids, according to the prophecy.

51
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,347
Didn't ye hear a word about them matters and something more, eh?

52
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,574
No, I don't think ye did, Halkuji.

53
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:40,337
Who knows it?"

54
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:42,038
Not all Nantucket, I guess.

55
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,580
But Al's ever, Mayhap.

56
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,563
He've heard tell about the leg, and how he lost an eye.

57
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,965
He have heard of that, I dare say.

58
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:58,733
Oh yes, that everyone knows a Most Eye, mean they know he's only one leg, and that a Parmaceti took the other off.

59
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:04,258
My friend, said I, what all this gibberish of yours is about, I don't know.

60
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:10,223
And I don't much care, for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head.

61
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:19,064
But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you that I know all about the loss of his leg."

62
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:20,606
"'All about it?

63
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,127
A shree do?

64
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:23,128
All?'

65
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:37,982
Pretty sure, with finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie, then, starting a little, turned and said, Graaâ€”' "'Your ship, Tavi?'

66
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,488
Names down on the papers?"

67
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:47,179
Well, well, what's signed is signed, And what's to be, will be, And then again, perhaps, it won't be After all.

68
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:53,127
Anyhow, it's all fixed And arranged ne'er ye dee, And some sailors or other Must go with him.

69
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,991
I suppose well These as any other men.

70
00:04:56,472 --> 00:05:03,702
God pity M. Morning to ye, shipmates, morning, The ineffable heavens bless ye, And sorry I stopped ye.

71
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,366
Look here, friend, said I,

72
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:10,013
If you have anything important to tell us, out with it.

73
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:14,883
But if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your game.

74
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:21,216
That's all I have to say."

75
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,502
I'll dress some men for him, the likes of ye.

76
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:27,524
Morning to ye, shipmates.

77
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:29,667
Morning."

78
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:33,752
Oh, when you get there, tell him I've concluded not to make one of him.

79
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:36,175
Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way.

80
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,136
You can't fool us.

81
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:42,342
It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him.

82
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,506
Morning to ye, shipmates.

83
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:46,427
Morning.

84
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:53,019
Mourning it is," said I. Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this crazy man.

85
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,489
But stop, tell me your name, will you?"

86
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:56,734
Eliza!

87
00:05:57,515 --> 00:05:58,176
Eliza!"

88
00:05:58,197 --> 00:06:09,836
thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor, and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear.

89
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:22,337
But we had not gone, perhaps, above a hundred yards, when, chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance?

90
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:36,620
Somehow the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did.

91
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:44,933
He did, and then, it seemed to me, that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine.

92
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:50,181
This circumstance, coupled with this ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk,

93
00:06:50,161 --> 00:07:03,100
Now begatten me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod, and Captain Ahab, and the leg he had lost, and the caporn fit, and the silver calabash, and what Captain Pellack had said of him.

94
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:14,818
When I left the ship the day previous, man, the perdition of the squall, tisti, cam, the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail, chin, and a hundred thundershadowy things.

95
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:27,191
I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.

96
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:31,322
But Elijah passed on without seeming to notice us.

97
00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:38,882
This relieved me, and once more, and finally, as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug
