00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:05,241
Chapter 19 The Prophet Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?

2
00:00:06,303 --> 00:00:21,212
Kwekwek and I had just left the Pequod and were sauntering away from the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above words were put to us by a stranger who, pausing before us, leveled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question.

3
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:27,801
He was but shabbily appareled in faded jacket and patched trousers, a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck.

4
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:37,974
A confluence smallpox had in all directions flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters had been dried up.

5
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:39,936
Have ye shipped in her?

6
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:40,958
he repeated.

7
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,621
You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose?

8
00:00:43,882 --> 00:00:48,027
said I, trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.

9
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:58,340
"'Aye, the Pequod, that ship there,' he said, drawing back his whole arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.

10
00:00:58,901 --> 00:00:59,902
"'Yes,' said I.

11
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:01,524
"'We have just signed the articles.

12
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:03,667
Anything down there about your souls?'

13
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:04,949
"'About what?'

14
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:08,213
"'Oh, perhaps you haven't got any,' he said quickly.

15
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,655
"'No matter, though.

16
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,158
I know many chaps that haven't got any.

17
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:16,343
Good luck to them, and they are all the better off for it.'

18
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:18,967
A soul's a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.

19
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:21,470
"'What are you jabbering about, shitmate?'

20
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:22,191
said I.

21
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:31,544
"'He's got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps,' abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon the word H.E.

22
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:33,267
"'Queequeg,' said I.

23
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:34,008
"'Let's go.

24
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:36,531
This fellow has broken loose from somewhere.

25
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:39,816
He's talking about something and somebody we don't know.'"

26
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:41,218
"'Stop!'

27
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:41,999
cried the stranger.

28
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,321
"'He said true.

29
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:45,404
You haven't seen Old Thunder yet, have ye?'

30
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:46,926
"'Who's Old Thunder?'

31
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:50,911
said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner.

32
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,493
"'Captain Ahab.'

33
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,454
"'What?

34
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:55,657
The captain of our ship, the Pequod?'

35
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:59,863
"'Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name.

36
00:01:59,883 --> 00:02:01,905
"'You haven't seen him yet, have ye?'

37
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:03,367
"'No, we haven't.

38
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,554
He's sick, they say, but is getting better, and will be all right again before long.'

39
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,682
All right again before long, laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh.

40
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:19,978
Look ye, when Captain Ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right, not before.

41
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,391
What do you know about him?

42
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:23,253
What did they tell you about him?

43
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:24,314
Say that.

44
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:26,776
They didn't tell much of anything about him.

45
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:30,920
Only I've heard that he's a good whale hunter and a good captain to his crew.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,381
That's true.

47
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:33,382
That's true.

48
00:02:33,783 --> 00:02:35,224
Yes, both true enough.

49
00:02:35,684 --> 00:02:37,346
But you must jump when he gives an order.

50
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,149
Step and growl, growl and go.

51
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:42,171
That's the word with Captain Ahab.

52
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:49,037
But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights.

53
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:53,060
Nothing about that deadly scrimmage with the Spaniard before the altar in Santa.

54
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:55,534
Heard nothing about that, eh?

55
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,826
Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into, and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage, according to the prophecy.

56
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:06,209
Didn't he hear a word about the matters and something more, eh?

57
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,492
No, I don't think he did.

58
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:09,212
How could ye?

59
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:10,033
Who knows it?

60
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:11,634
Not all Nantucket, I guess.

61
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:13,356
But how's ever, Mayhap?

62
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:15,898
Ye've heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it?

63
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:18,120
Aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.

64
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,243
Oh yes, that every one knows amost.

65
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:25,707
I mean they know he's only one leg, and that a Parma set he took the other off.

66
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:34,985
"'My friend,' said I, "'what all this gibberish of yours is about I don't know and I don't much care, for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head.

67
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:44,202
But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you that I know all about the loss of his leg.'"

68
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,323
"'Ey allow about it, eh?

69
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:46,284
Sure you do.

70
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:46,905
All?

71
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:47,786
Pretty sure."

72
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:58,178
With finger pointed and eye leveled at the Pequod, the beggar-like stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie, then starting a little, turned and said, "'Ye've shipped, have ye?

73
00:03:58,578 --> 00:03:59,760
Names down on the papers?

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:07,168
Well, well, what's signed is signed, and what's to be will be, and then again, perhaps it won't be, after all."

75
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:15,496
Anyhow, it's all fixed and arranged already, and some sailors or other must go with him, I suppose, as well these as any other men.

76
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:16,677
God pity him.

77
00:04:17,438 --> 00:04:18,679
Morning to you, shipmates.

78
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:19,500
Morning.

79
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,562
The ineffable heavens bless ye.

80
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:23,424
I'm sorry I stopped ye.

81
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:28,228
Look here, friend, said I, if you have anything important to tell us, out with it.

82
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:32,252
But if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your game.

83
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:34,354
That's all I have to say.

84
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:37,820
And it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way.

85
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,422
You are just the man for him.

86
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:40,724
The likes of ye.

87
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:42,407
Morning to ye, shipmates.

88
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:43,008
Morning.

89
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,435
Oh, when you get there, tell him I've concluded not to make one of him.

90
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:50,560
Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way.

91
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,721
You can't fool us.

92
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:56,489
It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him.

93
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,572
Morning to ye, shipmates.

94
00:04:58,973 --> 00:04:59,313
Morning.

95
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,198
Morning it is, said I.

96
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,702
Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this crazy man.

97
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:06,867
But stop, tell me your name, will you?

98
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:08,190
Elijah.

99
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:09,433
Elijah.

100
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:10,756
Elijah.

101
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:21,300
Thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor, and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear.

102
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:30,532
But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner and looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance?

103
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:41,890
Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did.

104
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:49,262
He did, and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine.

105
00:05:49,242 --> 00:06:08,162
This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod, and Captain Ahab, and the leg he had lost, and the Cape Horn fit, and the Silver Calabash, and what Captain Pellick had said of him.

106
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:30,775
when I left the ship the day previous, and the prediction of the Squatistic, and the prediction of the Squatistic, and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail, and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail, I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.

107
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:33,949
But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us.

108
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:41,642
This relieved me, and once more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.
