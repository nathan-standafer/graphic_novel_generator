00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,732
Book 2.

2
00:00:01,093 --> 00:00:02,755
Assembly of the People of Ithaca.

3
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:05,559
Speeches of Telemachus and of the Suetors.

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,707
Telemachus makes his preparations and starts for Pylos the with Minerva disguised as Mentor.

5
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:17,136
Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus rose and dressed himself.

6
00:00:17,737 --> 00:00:24,587
He bound his sandals onto his comely feet, girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an immortal god.

7
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:30,276
He had once sent the criers round to call the people in assembly, so they called them and the people gathered thereon.

8
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:37,288
Then, when they were got together, he went to the place of assembly spear in hand, not alone, for his two hounds went with him.

9
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:48,887
Minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marveled at him as he went by, and when he took his place in his father's seat, even the oldest counsellors made way for him.

10
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:54,428
Aegyptius, a man bent double with age and of infinite experience, was the first to speak.

11
00:00:55,209 --> 00:01:05,140
His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilias, land of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him.17.

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,808
He had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their father's land, while the third, Uranimus, was one of the suitors.

13
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:17,254
Nevertheless, their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still weeping for him when he began his speech.

14
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:19,860
Men of Ithaca, he said, hear my words.

15
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:24,310
From the day Ulysses left us there has been no meeting of our counsellors until now.

16
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:29,241
Who then can it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary to convene us?

17
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:36,677
Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?

18
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:41,444
I am sure he is an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him his heart's desire."

19
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:47,632
Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he was bursting with what he had to say.

20
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:52,499
He stood in the middle of the assembly and the good herald Pisanor brought him his staff.

21
00:01:53,020 --> 00:02:01,872
Then, turning to Aegyptius, "'Sir,' said he, "'it is I, as you will shortly learn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved.

22
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:08,363
I have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you, nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak.

23
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:13,833
My grievance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes which have fallen upon my house.

24
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:21,427
The first of these is the loss of my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and was like a father to every one of you.

25
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:26,796
The second is much more serious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate.

26
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:31,721
The sons of all the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will.

27
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:39,508
They are afraid to go to her father Acarius, asking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter.

28
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:49,517
But day by day they keep hanging about my father's house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink.

29
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,899
No estate can stand such recklessness.

30
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:57,424
We have now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them.

31
00:02:57,404 --> 00:03:00,046
I shall never all my days be as good a man as he was.

32
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:05,831
Still, I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer.

33
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:08,254
My house is being disgraced and ruined.

34
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:11,857
Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion.

35
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:17,121
Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be displeased and turn upon you.

36
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:25,909
I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is the beginning and the end of councils, do not hold back, my friends, and leave me single-handed eighteen.

37
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:33,421
unless it be that my brave father Ulysses did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors.

38
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:47,863
Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of house and home at all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till I got paid in full, whereas now I have no remedy.

39
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:48,504
19.

40
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:52,569
With this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into tears.

41
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:00,540
Everyone was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous who spoke thus.

42
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,987
Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw the blame upon us suitors?

43
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:10,172
It is your mother's fault, not ours, for she is a very artful woman.

44
00:04:10,152 --> 00:04:19,472
This three years past, and close on four, she had been driving us out of our minds by encouraging each one of us and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says.

45
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:22,278
And then there was that other trick she played us.

46
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,072
She set up a great tambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework.

47
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:32,357
"'Sweethearts,' said she, "'Ulysses is indeed dead.

48
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:34,921
Still do not press me to marry again immediately.

49
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:44,316
Wait, for I would not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes to be in readiness against the time when death shall take him.

50
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:49,744
He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.'

51
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:58,681
This was what she said, and we assented, whereon we could see her working on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight.

52
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:12,627
She fooled us in this way for three years, and we never found her out, but as time wore on, and she was now in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether she would or no.

53
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:18,086
The suitors, therefore, make you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand.

54
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:31,598
Send your mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father's choice, for I do not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is so clever.

55
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,820
We never yet heard of such a woman.

56
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,247
We know all about Tyro, Alcmena, Mycenae, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing to your mother, any one of them.

57
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:57,345
It was not fair of her to treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up your estate, and I do not see why she should change, for she gets all the honour and glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she.

58
00:05:57,325 --> 00:06:05,978
Understand, then, that we will not go back to our lands, neither here nor elsewhere, till she has made her choice and married someone or other of us."

59
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:10,886
Telemachus answered, "'And Tinnus, how can I drive the mother who bore me from my father's house?

60
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:14,451
My father is abroad, and we do not know whether he is alive or dead.

61
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:22,303
It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius the large sum which I must give him, if I insist on sending his daughter back to him.

62
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:26,328
Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will also punish me.

63
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:30,434
For my mother when she leaves, the house will call on the Irinias to avenge her.

64
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:34,960
Besides, it would not be a creditable thing to do, and I will have nothing to say to it.

65
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:43,431
If you choose to take offense at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another's houses at your own cost, turn and turn about.

66
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:54,262
If, on the other hand, you elect to persist in sponging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge you."

67
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:58,534
As he spoke, Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain,

68
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:03,734
and they flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly flight.

69
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:12,247
When they were right over the middle of the assembly, they wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and glaring death into the eyes of them that were below.

70
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:18,497
Then, fighting fiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right over the town.

71
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:36,368
The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what all this might be, whereon Halitharses, who was the best prophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and in all honesty, saying, Hear me men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to the suitors, for I see mischief brewing for them.

72
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,510
Ulysses is not going to be away much longer.

73
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,578
Indeed, he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction, not on them alone but on many another of us who live in Ithaca.

74
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,463
Let us then be wise in time and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes.

75
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,386
Let the suitors do so of their own accord.

76
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,930
It will be better for them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge.

77
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,676
Everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the Argive set out for Troy, and he with them.

78
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:11,234
I said that after going through much hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the twentieth year, and that no one would know him, and now all this is coming true.

79
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:18,268
Eurymachus son of Polybus then said, Go home, old man, and prophesy to your own children, or it may be worse for them.

80
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,134
I can read these omens myself much better than you can.

81
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:25,943
Birds are always flying about in the sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything.

82
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:36,223
Ulysses has died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger of Telemachus, which is fierce enough as it is.

83
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:46,198
I suppose you think he will give you something for your family, but I tell you, and it shall surely be when an old man like you who should know better, talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome.

84
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,844
In the first place his young friend will only fare so much the worse.

85
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:53,049
He will take nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this.

86
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:00,861
And in the next we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you.

87
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:11,197
As for Telemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect.

88
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:21,533
Till then we shall go on harassing him with our suit, for we fear no man, and care neither for him with all his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours.

89
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:25,220
You may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hate you the more.

90
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:41,310
We shall go back and continue to eat up Telemachus's estate without paying him, till such time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of expectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare perfection.

91
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:47,898
Besides, we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in due course, but for the way in which she treats us.

92
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:58,110
Then Telemachus said, Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say no more and entreat you no further, for the gods and the people of Ithaca now know my story.

93
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:07,922
Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos in quest of my father who has so long been missing.

94
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:13,652
Someone may tell me something, or, and people often hear things in this way, some heaven-sent message may direct me.

95
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:20,904
If I can hear of him as alive and on his way home, I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet another twelve months.

96
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:31,041
If, on the other hand, I hear of his death, I will return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make my mother marry again.

97
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:39,530
With these words he sat down, and Mentor Twenty, who had been a friend of Ulysses and had been left in charge of everything with full authority over the servants, rose to speak.

98
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,233
He then, plainly and in all honesty, addressed them thus.

99
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:45,175
Hear me, men of Ithaca.

100
00:10:45,555 --> 00:10:51,261
I hope that you may never have a kind and well-disposed ruler anymore, nor one who will govern you equitably.

101
00:10:51,661 --> 00:11:00,049
I hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for there is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you as though he were your father.

102
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:11,359
I am not half so angry with the suitors, for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts and wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take the high hand and eat up his estate.

103
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:21,693
But as for you others, I am shocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop such scandalous goings-on, which you could do if you chose, for you are many and they are few."

104
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:29,563
Leocritus, son of Evne, answered him, saying, Mentor, what folly is all this, that you should set the people to stay us?

105
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:32,969
It is a hard thing for one man to fight with many about his victuals.

106
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:48,818
Even though Ulysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly, would have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds.

107
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:50,762
There is no sense in what you have been saying.

108
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:59,721
Now, therefore, to you people go about your business and let his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all.

109
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:05,794
Which I do not think he will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till someone comes and tells him something.

110
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:12,309
On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own abode, while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.

111
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:18,799
Then Telemachus went all alone by the seaside, washed his hands in the grey waves, and prayed to Minerva.

112
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:26,550
Hear me, he cried, you God who visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the seas in search of my father, who has so long been missing.

113
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:33,183
I would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so."

114
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:38,853
As he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with the voice of Mentor.

115
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:49,213
"'Telemachus,' said she, "'if you are made of the same stuff as your father, you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half done.'"

116
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:58,855
If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless, but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins, I see no likelihood of your succeeding.

117
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:01,561
Sons are seldom as good men as their fathers.

118
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:04,007
They are generally worse, not better.

119
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:08,637
Still, as you are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward,

120
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:14,663
and are not entirely without some share of your father's wise discernment, I look with hope upon your undertaking.

121
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:27,937
But mind you never make common cause with any of those foolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to death and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that they shall perish on the same day.

122
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:31,060
As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed.

123
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,805
Your father was such an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship, and will come with you myself.

124
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:39,651
Now, however, return home, and go about among the suitors.

125
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:42,054
Begin getting provisions ready for your voyage.

126
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:51,708
See everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while I go round the town and beat up volunteers at once.

127
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:54,572
There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new.

128
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:57,697
I will run my eye over them for you and will choose the best.

129
00:13:57,997 --> 00:14:01,422
We will get her ready and will put out to sea without delay."

130
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:06,757
Thus spoke Minerva, daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no time in doing as the goddess told him.

131
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:11,911
He went moodily home and found the suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court.

132
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:16,744
Antinous came up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own, saying,

133
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:24,359
Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill blood, neither in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do.

134
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:33,838
The Achaeans will find you in everything, a ship and a picked crew to boot, so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your noble father.

135
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:40,479
Antinous answered Telemachus, I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of any kind with such men as you are.

136
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,305
Was it not enough that you should waste so much good property of mine, while I was yet a boy?

137
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:53,916
Now that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger, and whether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will do you all the harm I can.

138
00:14:54,497 --> 00:15:02,847
I shall go, and my going will not be in vain, though, thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and must be passenger, not captain.

139
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:05,790
As he spoke, he snatched his hand from that of Antinous.

140
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:12,458
Meanwhile, the others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, 201 jeering at him tauntingly as they did so.

141
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:16,342
"'Telemachus,' said one youngster, "'means to be the death of us.

142
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:22,309
I suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, or again from Sparta, where he seems bent on going.

143
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,315
Or will he go to Ephira as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?'

144
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:33,645
Another said, Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board Shib, he will be like his father and perish far from his friends.

145
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:38,432
In this case we should have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us.

146
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:42,177
As for the house, we can let his mother and the man who marries her have that.

147
00:15:42,798 --> 00:15:43,920
This was how they talked.

148
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:55,322
But Telemachus went down into the lofty and spacious storeroom where his father's treasure of gold and bronze lay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were kept in open chests.

149
00:15:55,342 --> 00:16:06,575
Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home again after all.

150
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:10,279
The room was closed with well-made doors opening in the middle.

151
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:17,293
Moreover, the faithful old housekeeper Eurycleia, daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both night and day.

152
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:31,373
Telemachus called her to the storeroom and said, Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you were keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he should escape death and find his way home again after all.

153
00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:34,437
Let me have twelve jars, and see that they all have lids.

154
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:39,885
Also fill me some well-sewn leathen bags with barley meal, about twenty measures in all.

155
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,310
Get these things put together at once, and say nothing about it.

156
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:47,536
I will take everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for the night.

157
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:53,344
I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear anything about the return of my dear father."

158
00:16:53,932 --> 00:17:01,731
When Eurycleia heard this she began to cry and spoke fondly to him, saying, My dear child, whatever can have put such notion as that into your head?

159
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:06,743
Where in the world do you want to go to, you who are the one hope of the house?

160
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:17,991
Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves.

161
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:24,023
Stay where you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and worrying your life out on the barren ocean.

162
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:26,029
"'Fear not, nurse,' answered Telemachus.

163
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:39,160
"'My scheme is not without heaven's sanction, but swear that you will say nothing about all this to my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she hears of my having gone, and asks you, for I do not want her to spoil her beauty by crying.'"

164
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:49,054
The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars and getting the... Then Minerva bethought her of another matter.

165
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:55,849
She took his shape and went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them to meet at the ship by sundown.

166
00:17:55,829 --> 00:18:01,240
She went also to Neumann son of Fronius, and asked him to let her have a ship, which he was very ready to do.

167
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:11,863
When the sun had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of the harbour.

168
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:15,590
Presently the crew came up and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.

169
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:20,460
Furthermore, she went to the house of Ulysses and threw the suitors into a deep slumber.

170
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:27,253
She caused their drink to fuddle them and made them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of sitting over their wine,

171
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:31,661
They went back into the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness.

172
00:18:32,342 --> 00:18:36,689
Then she took the form and voice of Mentor and called Telemachus to come outside.

173
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:44,162
Telemachus, said she, the men are on board and at their oars, waiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.

174
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:47,307
On this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps.

175
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:55,000
When they got to the ship, they found the crew waiting by the waterside, and Telemachus said, Now my men, help me to get the stores on board.

176
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:01,391
They are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not know anything about it, nor any of the maidservants except one.

177
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:05,678
With these words he led the way, and the others followed after.

178
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:14,834
When they had brought the things, as he told them, Telemachus went on board, Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel, while Telemachus sat beside her.

179
00:19:15,274 --> 00:19:18,159
Then the men loosed the horses and took their places on the benches.

180
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:31,041
Minerva sent them a fair wind from the west tether twenty-two that whistled over the deep blue waves twenty-three whereon Telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did as he told them.

181
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:36,402
They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays.

182
00:19:36,924 --> 00:19:41,402
Then they hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted oxhide.

183
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:48,741
As the sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.

184
00:19:49,644 --> 00:20:00,090
Then they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing bowls to the brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of Jove.

185
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:05,263
Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night from dark till dawn.
