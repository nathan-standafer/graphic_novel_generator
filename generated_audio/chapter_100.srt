00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,615
Chapter 100 - Leg and Arm.

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:07,482
The Pequod of Nantucket meets the Samuel Enderby of London.

3
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:09,344
Ship, ahoy!

4
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:10,686
Hast seen the white whale?

5
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:16,935
So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colors, bearing down under the stern.

6
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:28,452
Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his hoisted quarterboat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat's bow.

7
00:00:28,432 --> 00:00:44,571
He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot cloth, and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar's surcoat.

8
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:46,633
"'Has seen the white whale?

9
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:47,554
See o' this!'

10
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:56,565
And withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he held up a white arm of sperm whalebone, terminating in a wooden head like a mallet.

11
00:00:56,714 --> 00:01:01,745
Man my boat, cried Ahab impetuously and tossing about the oars near him.

12
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:03,589
Stand by to lower.

13
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:12,208
In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger.

14
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:14,972
But here a curious difficulty presented itself.

15
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:22,903
In the excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own.

16
00:01:23,404 --> 00:01:33,758
And then, it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning.

17
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:52,894
Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody, except those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen, to clamber up a ship's side from a boat on the open sea, for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it halfway down to the kelson.

18
00:01:52,874 --> 00:02:09,299
So, deprived of one leg, and the strained ship, of course, being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again, hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.

19
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:22,138
It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.

20
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:42,314
And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleats there, and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully ornamented man-ropes, for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea-banisters.

21
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:46,962
But this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain,

22
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:50,970
Observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, I see!

23
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,731
I see!

24
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:53,435
A vast heaving there!

25
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:56,280
Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting tackle!

26
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:09,186
As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.

27
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:16,038
This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook.

28
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:28,396
It was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling hand over hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle.

29
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:34,785
Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head.

30
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:58,339
With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, The other captain advanced, and Ahab, Putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm, Like two swordfish blades, cried out in his walrus way, Aye, aye, hearty, let us shake bones together, An arm and a leg, an arm that never can shrink, Dicey, and a leg that never can shrink, Dicey, and a leg that never can run.

31
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,702
Where didst thou see the white whale?

32
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:02,224
How long ago?

33
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:09,975
"'The white whale,' said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the east and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope.

34
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:13,380
There I saw him on the line last season.

35
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,384
"'And he took that arm off, did he?'

36
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:21,752
asked Ahab, now sliding down from the capstan and resting on the Englishman's shoulder as he did so.

37
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:25,157
"'Ay, he was the cause of it, at least, and that leg, too.'

38
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:27,780
"'Spin me the yarn,' said Ahab.

39
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,022
How was it?'

40
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:33,633
It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the line," began the Englishman.

41
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:36,557
I was ignorant of the white whale at that time.

42
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:42,325
Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of them.

43
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:51,718
A regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling round so that my boat's crew could only trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.

44
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:59,394
Presently up breeches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky white head and hump, all crow's feet and wrinkles.

45
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:08,908
It was he, it was he, cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended breath, and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.

46
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,092
Aye, aye, they were mine.

47
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:14,998
My irons, cried Ahab exultingly, but on.

48
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:18,904
Give me a chance then, said the Englishman good-humoredly.

49
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:27,060
Well, this old great-grandfather with the white head and hump runs all afoam into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my fast line.

50
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:32,389
Aye, I see, wanted to part it, free the fast fish, an old trick, I know him.

51
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:35,975
How it was exactly, continued the one-armed commander.

52
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:41,685
I do not know, but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow.

53
00:05:41,665 --> 00:05:47,797
But we didn't know it then, so that when we afterwards pulled on the line, bounce we came plump onto his hump.

54
00:05:48,399 --> 00:06:00,062
Instead of the other whales that went off to windward, all fluking, seeing how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was, the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life.

55
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:13,661
I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in, and thinking the haphazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw, for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a whale line.

56
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:17,949
Seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's boat.

57
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,454
Mr. Mounttop's here, by the way, Captain.

58
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:21,576
Mounttop!

59
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:22,438
Mounttop!

60
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,040
Mount Top, the captain.

61
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,267
As I was saying, I jumped into Mount Top's boat, which, I see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine.

62
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:35,212
Then, and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.

63
00:06:35,713 --> 00:06:38,716
But, Lord, look you, sir, hearts and souls alive, man.

64
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:52,071
The next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat, both eyes out, all befogged and bedeaded with black foam, the whale's tail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.

65
00:06:52,051 --> 00:07:13,602
No use sterning all then, but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding sun, all crown jewels as I was groping, I say, after the second iron to toss it overboard, down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters, and, flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was all chips.

66
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:16,506
We all struck out.

67
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:24,300
To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish.

68
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:40,468
But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash, and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here, clapping his hand just below his shoulder.

69
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:44,434
Yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to hell's flames.

70
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:55,932
I was thinking, when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ripped its way along the flesh, clear along the whole length of my arm, came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated.

71
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:59,858
And that gentleman there will tell you the rest, by the way, Captain.

72
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,664
Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon, Bunger, my lad, the captain.

73
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:07,570
Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn,

74
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:18,551
The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his gentlemanly rank on board.

75
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:22,377
His face was an exceedingly round but sober one.

76
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:34,654
He was dressed in a faded blue woolen frock or shirt and patched trousers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marling spike he held in one hand and a pillbox held in the other.

77
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:39,185
occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains.

78
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:47,445
But, at his superior's introduction of him to Ahab, he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captain's bidding.

79
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:51,381
It was a shocking bad wound, began the whale surgeon.

80
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:56,207
And, taking my advice, Captain Boomer here stood our old Sammy.

81
00:08:57,268 --> 00:09:02,114
Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship, interrupted the one-armed captain, addressing Ahab.

82
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:03,456
Go on, boy.

83
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:10,524
Stood our old Sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the line, but it was no use.

84
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:17,533
I did all I could, sat up with him nights, was very severe with him in the matter of diet.

85
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:32,789
Oh, very severe, chimed in the patient himself, then suddenly altering his voice, drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn't see to put on the bandages, and sending me to bed half-seas over, about three o'clock in the morning.

86
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,652
Oh, ye stars!

87
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:38,437
He sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet.

88
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:43,825
Oh, a great watcher and very dietetically severe is Dr. Bunger.

89
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:45,810
Bunger, you dog, laugh out.

90
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:46,732
Why don't ye?

91
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,157
You know you're a precious, jolly rascal.

92
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,182
But heave ahead, boy.

93
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:54,949
I'd rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man.

94
00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:04,750
My captain, you must have e'er this perceived respected, sir, said the imperturbable, godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab.

95
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,072
is apt to be facetious at times.

96
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:10,095
He spins us many clever things of that sort.

97
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:22,586
But I may as well say, en passant, as the French remark, that I myself, that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy, am a strict total abstinence man.

98
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:23,727
I never drink.

99
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:26,290
Water, cried the captain.

100
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,471
He never drinks it.

101
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:28,772
It's a sort of fits to him.

102
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:31,234
Fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia.

103
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:33,977
But go on, go on with the arm story.

104
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:36,839
Yes, I may as well," said the surgeon coolly.

105
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:46,493
I was about observing, sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, that spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse.

106
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:53,723
The truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw, more than two feet and several inches long.

107
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:55,906
I measured it with the lead lime.

108
00:10:55,926 --> 00:10:57,989
In short, it grew black.

109
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,713
I knew what was threatened, and off it came.

110
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:03,998
But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there.

111
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:08,334
That thing is against all rule," pointing at it with the marling spike.

112
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:11,101
That is the captain's work, not mine.

113
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:12,784
He ordered the carpenter to make it.

114
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:20,502
He had that club hammer there put to the end, to knock someone's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once.

115
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:23,165
He flies into diabolical passions sometimes.

116
00:11:23,665 --> 00:11:25,007
Do you see this dent, sir?

117
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:35,077
Removing his hat and brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scary trace or any token of ever having been a wound.

118
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:38,241
Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here, he knows.

119
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:41,664
No, I don't, said the captain, but his mother did.

120
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:42,866
He was born with it.

121
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:45,969
Oh, you solemn rogue, you, you bunger.

122
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,813
Was there ever such another bunger in the watery world?

123
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:50,354
Bunger.

124
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:53,480
When you die, you ought to die in pickle, you dog.

125
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,345
You should be preserved to future ages, you rascal."

126
00:11:57,086 --> 00:11:58,589
What became of the white whale?

127
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:04,680
now cried Ahab, who thus far had been impatiently listening to this byplay between the two Englishmen.

128
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,033
Oh, cried the one-armed captain.

129
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:07,874
Oh, yes!

130
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:12,240
Well, after he sounded, we didn't see him again for some time.

131
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:23,796
In fact, as I before hinted, I didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till sometime afterwards, when coming back to the line, we heard about Moby Dick, as some call him.

132
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:25,980
And then I knew it was he.

133
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,483
Didst thou cross his wake again?

134
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:29,505
Twice.

135
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:31,307
But could not fasten?

136
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:34,752
Didn't want to try to, ain't one limb enough.

137
00:12:34,732 --> 00:12:36,716
What should I do without this other arm?

138
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:40,623
And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so much as he swallows.

139
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:46,013
Well then, interrupted Bunger, give him your left arm for bait to get the right.

140
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,076
Do you know, gentlemen?

141
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:52,825
Very gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in succession.

142
00:12:53,513 --> 00:13:04,311
Do you know, gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man's arm?

143
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:10,982
And he knows it, too, so that what you take for the white whale's malice is only his awkwardness.

144
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:15,853
For he never means to swallow a single limb, he only thinks to terrify by feints.

145
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:27,300
But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jackknives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest.

146
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,430
And there it stayed for a twelve month or more, when I gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in small tacks, I see.

147
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:39,500
No possible way for him to digest that jackknife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.

148
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:50,297
Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours.

149
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:54,604
Only let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that's all.

150
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,329
"'No, thank ye, Bunger,' said the English captain.

151
00:13:57,349 --> 00:14:03,299
"'He's welcome to the arm he has, since I can't help it, and didn't know him then, but not to another one.

152
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,588
No more white whales for me, I've lowered for him once, and that has satisfied me.

153
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:14,979
There would be great glory in killing him, I know that, and there is a shipload of precious sperm in him.

154
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:19,967
But, hark ye, he's best let alone, don't you think so, captain?'

155
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:21,409
glancing at the ivory leg.

156
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,513
He is, but he will still be hunted for all that.

157
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:26,256
What is best, let alone?

158
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:29,200
That accursed thing is not always what least allures.

159
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,402
He's all a magnet.

160
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:32,444
How long since thou saw'st him last?

161
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:33,526
Which way heading?

162
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:41,597
Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiends, cried Bunger, stoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing.

163
00:14:41,978 --> 00:14:42,859
This man's blood.

164
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,121
Bring the thermometer.

165
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,443
It's at the boiling point.

166
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,946
His pulse makes these planks beat.

167
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:51,734
taking a lancet from his pocket and drawing near to Ahab's arm.

168
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:53,377
Avast!

169
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:56,403
roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks.

170
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:57,806
Man the boat!

171
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:58,908
Which way heading?

172
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,511
Good God!

173
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:03,477
cried the English captain, to whom the question was put.

174
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:04,900
What's the matter?

175
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,964
He was heading east, I think.

176
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:09,112
Is your captain crazy?"

177
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:10,274
whispered Fadala.

178
00:15:11,054 --> 00:15:21,105
But Fadala, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take the boat's steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting tackle towards him, commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower.

179
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:26,271
In a moment he was standing in the boat's stern, and the Manila men were springing to their oars.

180
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,953
In vain the English captain hailed him.

181
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:37,002
With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.
