CHAPTER XXXVII.

2
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:01,834
SUNSET.

3
00:00:02,394 --> 00:00:06,360
THE CABIN BY THE STERN WINDOWS Ahab, sitting alone and gazing out.

4
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:11,808
I leave a white and turbid wake, Pale waters, paler cheeks, where I sail.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,495
The envious billows side-long swell To whelm my track, let them but.

6
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:17,837
First I pass.

7
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:31,699
Yonder by ever-brimming goblets rim The warm waves blush like wine, The gold brow plums the blue, The diver's sun-slow dived from noon goes, My soul mounts up, she wearies with her endless hill.

8
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:37,108
Is then the crown too heavy that I wear, This iron crown of Lombardy?

9
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:46,424
Yet is it bright with many a gem either wearer, See not its far flashings, but darkly feel, That I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds.

10
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:55,500
Tis iron that I know not gold, tis split too, That I feel the jagged edge galls me so, My brain seems to beat against the solid metal.

11
00:00:56,362 --> 00:01:02,252
I, steel skull, mine the sword that needs no helmet In the most brain-battering fight.

12
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:04,875
Dry heat upon my brow, O!

13
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:09,739
Time was, when as the sunrise Nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed.

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:26,796
No more, this lovely light, It lights not me, or loveliness is anguish To me, since I can ne'er enjoy, Gifted with a high perception, I lack the low, Enjoying power damned, most supply And most malignantly damned in the midst Of Paradise.

15
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:28,678
Good night, good night.

16
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:31,563
Waving his hand, he moves from the window.

17
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:36,052
"'Twas not so hard a task, I thought, to find one stubborn.

18
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:41,302
At the least, but my one-cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they revolve.

19
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:49,958
Or, if you will, like so many anthills of powder, they all stand before me, and I their match.

20
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:53,683
that to fire others the match itself must needs be wasting.

21
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:58,109
What I've dared, I've willed, and what I've willed, I'll do.

22
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,335
They think me mad, Starbuck does, but I'm demoniac.

23
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:08,404
I am madness maddened, that wild madness that's only came to comprehend itself.

24
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:11,288
The prophecy was that I should be dismembered and

25
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:13,892
Iâ€”I lost this leg.

26
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:17,276
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer.

27
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,661
Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one.

28
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,865
That's more than ye, ye great gods, ever were.

29
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,267
I laugh, and who did ye?

30
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:30,814
Ye cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye death-berks and blinded bendigos.

31
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:34,339
I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies.

32
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:42,132
Take some one of your own size, don't pommel M. No, you've knocked me down, And I am up again, but ye have run and hidden.

33
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:46,839
Come forth from behind your cotton-bags, I have no long gun to reach ye.

34
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:51,587
Come, Ahab's compliments to ye, Come and see if you can swerve me.

35
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:52,589
Swerve me?

36
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:55,634
you cannot swerve me, I'll see swerve yourselves.

37
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:57,677
Man has you there.

38
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:04,210
Swerve me, the path to my fixed purpose Is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.

39
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:16,493
Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts Of mountains, under torrents' beds, unerringly I rush, Nought's an obstacle, nought's an angle to the iron way.
