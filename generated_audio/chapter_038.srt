00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:05,176
Chapter 38 - Dusk. By the main-maced Starbuck leaning against it.

2
00:00:05,777 --> 00:00:13,765
My soul is more than matched, she's overmanned, and by a madman, insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field.

3
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:17,829
But he drilled deep down and blasted all my reason out of me.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,334
I think I see his impious end, but feel that I must help him to it.

5
00:00:22,994 --> 00:00:29,481
Will I, nill I, the ineffable thing, has tied me to him, tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut.

6
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:30,602
"'Horrible old man!

7
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:31,624
Who's over him?'

8
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:32,324
he cries.

9
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:35,528
"'Ay, he would be a Democrat to all above.

10
00:00:35,788 --> 00:00:37,971
Look, how he lords it over all below.

11
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:38,972
Oh!

12
00:00:38,992 --> 00:00:41,815
I plainly see my miserable office.

13
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:46,561
To obey rebelling, and worse yet, to hate with touch of pity.

14
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:51,006
For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it.

15
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:52,328
Yet is there hope.

16
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,131
Time and tide flow wide.

17
00:00:55,364 --> 00:01:01,287
The hated whale has the round, watery world to swim in, as the small gold fish has its glassy globe.

18
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,745
His heaven-insulting purpose God may wedge aside.

19
00:01:05,827 --> 00:01:07,871
I would apart were it not like lead.

20
00:01:08,572 --> 00:01:14,022
But my whole clocks run down, my heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.

21
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:17,269
A burst of revelry from the forecastle.

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:26,586
O God, to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them, whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea!

23
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,792
The white whale is their demigorgon.

24
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:30,977
Hark, the infernal orgies!

25
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:32,882
That revelry is forward.

26
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:35,308
Mark the unfaltering silence aft.

27
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:42,887
Methinks it pictures life, foremost through the sparkling sea-shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow.

28
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:53,495
but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake, and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings.

29
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:56,120
The long howl thrills me through.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,426
Peace, ye revelers, and set the watch.

31
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,770
Oh, life!

32
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,678
Tis in an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge, as wild, untutored things are forced to feed.

33
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,842
O life, tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee.

34
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:16,006
But tis not me, that horror is out of me.

35
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:21,812
And with the soft feeling of the human in me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim phantom futures.

36
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:26,998
Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences.
