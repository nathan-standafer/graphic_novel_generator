00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,853
Book VIII.

2
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:04,439
Banquet in the House of Alcinus the Games.

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:13,617
Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinus and Ulysses both rose, and Alcinus led the way to the Phaeacian place of assembly, which was near the ships.

4
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:17,584
When they got there they sat down side by side on a seat of polished stone,

5
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:23,514
while Minerva took the form of one of Alcinus' servants and went round the town in order to help Ulysses to get home.

6
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:36,174
She went up to the citizens, man by man, and said, Alderman and town councillors of the Phaeacians, come to the assembly, all of you, and listen to the stranger who has just come off a long voyage to the house of King Alcinus.

7
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,678
He looks like an immortal god.

8
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:45,387
With these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded.

9
00:00:46,088 --> 00:01:03,231
Everyone was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he really was, that he might impress the Phaeacians favorably as being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials of skill to which they would challenge him.

10
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:06,295
Then, when they were got together, Alcinas spoke.

11
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:12,381
Hear me, said he, alderman and town councillors of the Phaeacians, that I may speak even as I am minded.

12
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:18,729
This stranger, whoever he may be, has found his way to my house from somewhere or other, either east or west.

13
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:21,952
He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled.

14
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:26,097
Let us then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before him.

15
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:32,965
Indeed, no one, whoever yet came to my house, has been able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough.

16
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:40,285
Let us draw a ship into the sea, one that has never yet made a voyage, and man her with two and fifty of our smartest young sailors.

17
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:48,322
Then, when you have made fast your oars, each by his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to prepare a feast six-five.

18
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:50,447
I will find you in everything."

19
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:59,882
I am giving these instructions to the young men who will form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town councillors, you will join me in entertaining our guest in the cloisters.

20
00:02:00,363 --> 00:02:07,795
I can take no excuses, and we will have Demodocus to sing to us, for there is no bard like him whatever he may choose to sing about.

21
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:12,623
Alcinas then led the way and the others followed after while a servant went to fetch Demodocus.

22
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:28,062
The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to the seashore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound the oars to the thulpins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft.

23
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:33,252
They moored the vessel a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house of King Alcinus.

24
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:44,474
The outhouse is sixty-six yards, and all the precincts were filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young, and Alcinus killed them a dozen sheep, eight full-grown pigs, and two oxen.

25
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:48,902
These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet.

26
00:02:48,882 --> 00:03:00,416
A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil, for though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of his eyesight.

27
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:05,042
Pontinus set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it up against a bearing post.

28
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:10,709
He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands.

29
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:18,298
He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.

30
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:38,641
The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, the muse inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a matter that was then in the mouths of all men to wit, the quarrel between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on one another as they sat together at a banquet.

31
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:43,206
But Agamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another,

32
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:48,211
For Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor to consult the oracle.

33
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:54,436
Here was the beginning of the evil, that by the will of Jove fell both upon Danans and Trojans.

34
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:56,158
Thus sang the bard.

35
00:03:56,558 --> 00:04:03,084
But Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head and covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he was weeping.

36
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:11,472
When the bard left off singing, he wiped the tears from his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to the gods.

37
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:19,981
when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly.

38
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:26,008
No one noticed his distress except Alcinius, who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving.

39
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:35,779
So he at once said, Alderman and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy, that is its due accompaniment.

40
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:40,564
Let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home,

41
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:46,794
may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners."

42
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:50,420
With these words he led the way, and the others followed after.

43
00:04:51,081 --> 00:05:06,265
A servant hung Demodocus's lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports, a crowd of several thousands of people followed them, and there were many excellent competitors for all the prizes.

44
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:18,571
Acronios, Ocealus, Elatreus, Nauteus, Primneus, Eretmius, Eretmius, Pontius, Praurius, Thune, Anabasinius, and Amphialus son of Polonius, son of Tecton.

45
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:26,869
There was also Eurylus, son of Naublus, who was like Mars himself, and was the best-looking man among the Phaeacians except Laodamas.

46
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:31,195
Three sons of Alcinus, Laodamus, Halleus, and Plitonius competed also.

47
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:33,319
The foot races came first.

48
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,708
The course was set out for them from the starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew forward at the same moment.

49
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:42,853
Plitonius came in first by a long way.

50
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:49,903
He left everyone else behind him by the length of the furrow that a couple of mules can plow in a fallow field .67.

51
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:55,537
They then turned to the painful art of wrestling, and here Urialus proved to be the best man.

52
00:05:56,239 --> 00:06:02,695
Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the disc there was no one who could approach Eletrius.

53
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:12,939
Alcinous's son Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had all been diverted with the games, Let us ask the stranger whether he excels in any of these sports.

54
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:14,881
He seems very powerfully built.

55
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:19,945
His thighs, calves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all old.

56
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:26,011
But he has suffered much lately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, no matter how strong he is.

57
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:29,093
You are quite right, Laodamas, replied Eurylus.

58
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:31,956
Go up to your guest and speak to him about it yourself.

59
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:42,784
When Laodamus heard this, he made his way into the middle of the crowd and said to Ulysses, I hope, sir, that you will enter yourself for someone or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of them, and you must have gone in for many.

60
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:49,413
There is nothing that does anyone so much credit all his life long as the showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet.

61
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,538
Have a try, therefore, at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind.

62
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:56,121
Your return home will not be long delayed.

63
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:59,268
for the ship is already drawn into the water and the crew is found.

64
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:03,857
Ulysses answered, Laodamus, why do you taunt me in this way?

65
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:07,304
My mind is set rather on cares than contests.

66
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:16,523
I have been through infinite trouble and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and people to further me on my return home.

67
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:24,301
Then Eurylus reviled him outright and said, I gather, then, that you are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in.

68
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:33,040
I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of their outward freights and homeward cargos.

69
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,047
There does not seem to be much of the athlete about you.

70
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:40,942
"'For shame, sir,' answered Ulysses fiercely, "'you are an insolent fellow.

71
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:46,369
"'So true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike "'in speech, person, and understanding.

72
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:53,537
"'One man may be of weak presence, "'but heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation "'that he charms everyone who sees him.

73
00:07:53,557 --> 00:08:00,926
"'His honeyed moderation carries his hearers with him "'so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, "'and wherever he goes he is looked up to.

74
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:05,832
"'Another may be as handsome as a god, "'but his good looks are not crowned with discretion.

75
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:06,754
This is your case.

76
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:11,103
No god could make a finer-looking fellow than you are, but you are a fool.

77
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:19,459
Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you are quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises.

78
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:24,850
Indeed, so long as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of the age.

79
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:32,401
Now, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea.

80
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:37,628
Still, in spite of all this, I will compete, for your taunts have stung me to the quick."

81
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:48,424
So he hurried up, without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc, larger, more massive, and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians when disc-throwing among themselves .68.

82
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:53,834
Then, swinging it back, he threw it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he did so.

83
00:08:54,334 --> 00:09:01,407
The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it sped gracefully from his hand and flew beyond any mark that had been made yet.

84
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:05,875
Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked the place where it had fallen.

85
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:11,024
"'A blind man, sir,' said she, "'could easily tell your mark by groping for it.

86
00:09:11,465 --> 00:09:13,348
It is so far ahead of any other.'

87
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:18,617
You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no Phaeacian can come near to such a throw as yours."

88
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:24,806
Ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers on, so he began to speak more pleasantly.

89
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:31,978
"'Young men,' said he, "'come up to that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even heavier.'"

90
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:36,708
If anyone wants to have a bout with me, let him come on, for I am exceedingly angry.

91
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:47,352
I will box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it is, with any man of you all except Laodamus, but not with him because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one's own personal friend.

92
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:56,086
At least, I do not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a guest to challenge his host's family at any game, especially when he is in a foreign country.

93
00:09:56,687 --> 00:10:05,762
He will cut the ground from under his own feet if he does, but I make no exception as regards anyone else, for I want to have the matter out and know which is the best man.

94
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:09,748
I am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport known among mankind.

95
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,471
I am an excellent archer.

96
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:18,421
In battle I am always the first to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more are taking aim at him alongside of me.

97
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:24,851
Philoptetes was the only man who could shoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy and in practice.

98
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:30,940
I far excel everyone else in the whole world, of those who still eat bread upon the face of the earth.

99
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:38,295
But I should not like to shoot against the mighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus, the Iucalian, men who could shoot against the gods themselves.

100
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:45,891
This, in fact, was how Eurytus came prematurely by his end, for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer.

101
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:50,160
I can throw a dart farther than anyone else can shoot an arrow.

102
00:10:50,208 --> 00:11:00,477
Running is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea, my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak.

103
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:20,215
They all held their peace, except King Alcinus, who began, Sir, we have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, as having been displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by anyone who knows how to talk with propriety.

104
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:31,911
I hope you will apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any one of your chief men who may be dining with yourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds.

105
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:40,262
We are not particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors.

106
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:43,486
We are extremely fond of good dinners, music, and dancing.

107
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:47,550
We also like frequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds.

108
00:11:47,991 --> 00:12:00,162
So now, please, some of you who are the best dancers set about dancing, that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, and minstrels.

109
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:05,828
Demodocus has left his lyre at my house, so run someone or other of you and fetch it for him.

110
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:12,639
On this, a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king's house, and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward.

111
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,028
It was their business to manage everything connected with the sports, so they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.

112
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:33,604
Presently, the servant came back with Demodocus' lyre, and he took his place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in the town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.

113
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:39,790
Meanwhile, the bard began to sing the lubs of Mars and Venus, and how they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan.

114
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:47,819
Mars made Venus many presents, and defiled King Vulcan's marriage bed, so the son, who saw what they were about, told Vulcan.

115
00:12:48,640 --> 00:13:01,313
Vulcan was very angry when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some chains which none could either unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place.

116
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:03,128
6-9.

117
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,197
When he had finished his snare, he went into his bedroom and festooned the bedposts all over with chains like cobwebs.

118
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:12,402
He also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling.

119
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,807
Not even a god could see them so fine and subtle, were they?

120
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:25,061
As soon as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was the one he was most fond of.

121
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:32,211
But Mars kept no blind lookout, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to his house, burning with love for Venus.

122
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:43,230
Now Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and was about sitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took her hand in his own, Let us go to the couch of Vulcan.

123
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,681
He is not at home, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Scythians, whose speech is barbarous.

124
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,125
She was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their rest.

125
00:13:52,585 --> 00:14:00,534
Whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too late that they were in a trap.

126
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:07,401
Then Vulcan came up to them, for he had turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun told him what was going on.

127
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:13,588
He was in a furious passion, and stood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the gods.

128
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:21,464
Father Jove, he cried, and all you other blessed gods who live forever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will show you.

129
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:25,272
Jove's daughter Venus is always dishonoring me because I am lame.

130
00:14:25,953 --> 00:14:30,683
She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and clean-built, whereas I am a cripple,

131
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:34,809
But my parents are to blame for that, not I. They ought never to have begotten me.

132
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,513
Come and see the pair together asleep on my bed.

133
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:39,496
It makes me furious to look at them.

134
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:41,439
They are very fond of one another.

135
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,366
But I do not think they will lie there longer than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep much.

136
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:52,435
There, however, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave him for his baggage of a daughter.

137
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,077
who is fair but not honest.

138
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,981
On this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan.

139
00:14:57,461 --> 00:15:04,610
Earth-encircling Neptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the goddesses stayed at home, all of them for shame.

140
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:20,430
Then the givers of all good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been, whereon one would turn towards his neighbor, saying, Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong.

141
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:27,997
See how limping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god in heaven, and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages."

142
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:29,758
Thus did they converse.

143
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:38,326
But King Apollo said to Mercury, Messenger Mercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains were, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?

144
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:49,776
King Apollo answered Mercury, I only wish I might get the chance, though there were three times as many chains, and you might look on, all of you, gods and goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could.

145
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:56,927
The immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune took it all seriously and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free again.

146
00:15:57,308 --> 00:16:05,040
Let him go, he cried, and I will undertake, as you require, that he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among the immortal gods.

147
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,003
Do not, replied Vulcan.

148
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:08,104
Ask me to do this.

149
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:10,528
A bad man's bond is bad security.

150
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:16,978
What remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?

151
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,085
Vulcan, said Neptune, if Mars goes away without paying his damages, I will pay you myself.

152
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:26,110
So Vulcan answered, in this case I cannot and must not refuse you.

153
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:37,284
Thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were free they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and Lafter, loving Venus to Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar from?

154
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:46,476
Here the graces bathed her and anointed her with oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.

155
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:51,622
Thus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were charmed as they heard him.

156
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:57,229
Then Alcinius told Laodamus and Halius to dance alone, for there was no one to compete with them.

157
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:08,062
So they took a red ball which Polybus had made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and caught it with ease before it came down again.

158
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:12,447
When they had done throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance,

159
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:20,208
and at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great stamping with their feet.

160
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:28,410
Then Ulysses said, King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so.

161
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,054
I was astonished as I saw them.

162
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:39,145
The King was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaeacians, aldermen, and town councillors, Our guest seems to be a person of singular judgment.

163
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:43,550
Let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably expect.

164
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:47,715
There are twelve chief men among you, and counting myself there are thirteen.

165
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:52,341
Contribute, each of you, a clean cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold.

166
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:58,448
Let us give him all this in a lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with a light heart.

167
00:17:58,428 --> 00:18:03,594
As for Euryalus, he will have to make a formal apology and a present too, for he has been rude.

168
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:08,941
The others, all of them applauded his saying, and sent their servants to fetch the presents.

169
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:14,968
Then Euryalus said, King Alcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require.

170
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:20,014
He shall have my sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of silver.

171
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:23,760
I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into which it fits.

172
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:26,165
It will be worth a great deal to him."

173
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:32,716
As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, "'Good luck to you, father stranger.

174
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:44,095
If anything has been said amiss may the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return, for I understand you have been long away from home and have gone through much hardship.

175
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:49,903
To which Ulysses answered, Good luck to you too, my friend, and may the gods grant you every happiness.

176
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:54,068
I hope you will not miss the sword you have given me along with your apology.

177
00:18:54,649 --> 00:19:04,542
With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders, and towards sundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants of the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous.

178
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,968
Here his sons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge.

179
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:12,975
Then Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their seats.

180
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:19,647
Wife, said he, turning to Queen Aritae, go, fetch the best chest we have and put a clean cloak and shirt in it.

181
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:22,832
Also, set a copper on the fire and heat some water.

182
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:24,415
Our guest will take a warm bath.

183
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:28,703
See also to the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made him.

184
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:32,830
He will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that will follow.

185
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:43,824
I shall myself give him this golden goblet, which is of exquisite workmanship, that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his life, whenever he makes a drink offering to Jove, or to any of the gods.

186
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:44,985
70.

187
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:54,116
Then Arite told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath-water onto a clear fire.

188
00:19:54,657 --> 00:20:00,264
They threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.

189
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,365
21.

190
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:09,634
Meanwhile, Arite brought a magnificent chest from her own room, and inside it she packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought.

191
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:21,687
Lastly, she added a cloak and a good shirt from Alcinus, and said to Ulysses, See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for fear anyone should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your ship.

192
00:20:21,707 --> 00:20:22,628
72.

193
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:29,175
When Ulysses heard this, he put the lid on the chest and made it fast with a bond that Circe had taught him.

194
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:33,362
He had done so before an upper servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself.

195
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:44,300
He was very glad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her had taken as good care of him as though he had been a god.

196
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:54,336
When the servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bathroom and joined the guests who were sitting over their wine.

197
00:20:54,485 --> 00:21:01,422
Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the bearing posts supporting the roof of the cloister and admired him as she saw him pass.

198
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:03,728
Farewell, stranger, said she.

199
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:10,485
Do not forget me when you are safe at home again, for it is to me first that you owe a ransom for having saved your life.

200
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:22,345
And Ulysses said, Now Sychaia, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home, so shall I bless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved me.

201
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:25,850
When he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous.

202
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,176
Supper was then served, and the wine was mixed for drinking.

203
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:34,144
A servant led in the favored bard, Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company.

204
00:21:34,124 --> 00:21:37,949
near one of the bearing posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean against it.

205
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:52,446
Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of fat, for there was abundance left on the joint, and said to a servant, Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell him to eat it, for all the pain his lays may cause me, I will salute him nonetheless.

206
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:58,073
Bards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the muse teaches them their songs and loves them.

207
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:03,497
The servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who took it and was very much pleased.

208
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:14,873
They then laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had to eat and drink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, Demodocus, there is no one in the world whom I admire more than I do you.

209
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:23,925
You must have studied under the Muse, Jove's daughter, and under Apollo, so accurately do you sing the return of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures.

210
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:27,998
If you were not there yourself, you must have heard it all from someone who was.

211
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:41,002
Now, however, change your song and tell us of the wooden horse which Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got by stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who afterwards sacked the city.

212
00:22:41,523 --> 00:22:47,314
If you will sing this tale aright, I will tell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you."

213
00:22:48,560 --> 00:23:01,355
The bard inspired of heaven took up the story, at the point where some of the Argive set fire to their tents and sailed away, while others, hidden within the Horst 73, were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan place of assembly.

214
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:10,585
For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it, and were in three minds as to what they should do.

215
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:12,487
Some were for breaking it up then and there.

216
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:22,056
Others would have it dragged to the top of the rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice, while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation for the gods.

217
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:32,426
And this was how they settled it in the end, for the city was doomed when it took in that horse, within which were all the bravest of the Argives waiting to bring death and destruction on the Trojans.

218
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:40,234
And on he sang how the sons of the Achaeans issued from the horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their ambuscade.

219
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:48,805
He sang how they overran the city hither and thither and ravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with Menelaus to the house of Dyphobos.

220
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:55,333
It was there that the fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by Minerva's help he was victorious.

221
00:23:56,194 --> 00:24:01,681
All this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his cheeks were wet with tears.

222
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:08,770
He wept as a woman weeps when she throws herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city and people,

223
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,314
fighting bravely in defense of his home and children.

224
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:25,493
She screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back and shoulders and carry her off into slavery, to a life of labor and sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks.

225
00:24:26,234 --> 00:24:36,208
Even so piteously did Ulysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except Alcinous, who was sitting near him and could hear the sobs and sighs that he was heaving.

226
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:45,683
The king therefore at once rose and said, Alderman and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease his song, for there are those present who do not seem to like it.

227
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:52,915
From the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing, our guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting.

228
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:59,082
He is evidently in great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy ourselves, hosts and guests alike.

229
00:24:59,683 --> 00:25:15,021
This will be much more as it should be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we are making with so much good will, are wholly in his honour, and anyone with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.

230
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:21,088
Therefore, sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment nor reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you?

231
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:24,212
It will be more polite in you to give me a plain answer.

232
00:25:24,652 --> 00:25:31,921
Tell me the name by which your father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which you were known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens.

233
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:41,532
There is no one, neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name whatever, for people's fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born.

234
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:47,727
Tell me also your country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there.

235
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:57,732
For the Phaeacians have no pilots, their vessels have no rudders, as those of other nations have, but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are thinking about and want.

236
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:08,346
They know all the cities and countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that there is no danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm.

237
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:15,294
Still I do remember hearing my father say that Neptune was angry with us for being too easy going in the matter of giving people escorts.

238
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:24,225
He said that one of these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted someone 74 and bury our city under a high mountain.

239
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:31,596
This is what my father used to say, but whether the god will carry out his threat or no is a matter which he will decide for himself.

240
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:34,600
And now, tell me and tell me true.

241
00:26:35,381 --> 00:26:38,325
Where have you been wandering, and in what countries have you travelled?

242
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:46,958
Tell us of the peoples themselves, and of their cities who were hostile, savage, and uncivilised, and who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane.

243
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:53,487
Tell us also why you are made so unhappy on hearing about the return of the Argive Danans from Troy.

244
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:59,982
The gods arranged all this and sent them their misfortunes in order that future generations might have something to sing about.

245
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:04,092
Did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife's when you were before Troy?

246
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:10,025
A son-in-law or father-in-law, which are the nearest relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood?

247
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:17,162
Or was it some brave and kindly-natured comrade, for a good friend is as dear to a man as his own brother?
