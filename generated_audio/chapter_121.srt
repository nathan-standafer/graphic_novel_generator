Chapter 121 Midnight - The Forecastle Bulwarks.

00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,350
Chapter 121 Midnight - The Forecastle Bulwarks.

3
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:06,479
S.T.U.B.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,387
and Flask mounted on them.

5
00:00:08,637 --> 00:00:12,102
and passing additional lashings over the anchors there hanging.

6
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:19,092
No, stub, you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying.

7
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,576
And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary?

8
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:34,493
Didn't you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward?

9
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:36,395
Stop, now, didn't you say so?

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,377
Well, suppose I did.

11
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:39,118
What then?

12
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,981
I've part-changed my flesh since that time.

13
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:43,022
Why not my mind?

14
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,725
Besides, supposing we A.R.

15
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:52,553
loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward, how the devil could the lucifers get a fire in the strenching spray here?

16
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:57,338
Why, my little man, you have pretty red hair, but you couldn't get a fire now.

17
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:04,125
Shake yourself, your Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask, might fill pitchers at your coat-collar.

18
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:09,143
Don't you see, then, that for these extra risks the marine insurance companies have extra guarantees?

19
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,231
Here are hydrants, Flask.

20
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:14,723
But hark, again, and I'll answer ye the other thing.

21
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:19,804
First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope.

22
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:20,546
Now listen.

23
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:30,103
What's the mighty difference between holding a mast's lightning rod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasn't got any lightning rod at all in a storm?

24
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:37,356
Don't you see, you timberhead, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is first struck?

25
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:39,900
What are you talking about, then?

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,264
Not one ship in a hundred carries rods.

27
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:52,800
And Ahab, I, man, and all of us, were in no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews and ten thousand ships now sailing the seas.

28
00:01:53,541 --> 00:02:06,681
Why, you king-post, you, I suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightning rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia officer's skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash.

29
00:02:07,184 --> 00:02:08,926
Why don't ye be sensible, flask?

30
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:10,547
It's easy to be sensible.

31
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:11,788
Why don't ye then?

32
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,711
Any man with half an eye can be sensible.

33
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:16,713
I don't know that, stub.

34
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:18,835
You sometimes find it rather hard.

35
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:23,199
Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,380
That's a fact.

37
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,923
And I am about drenched with this spray.

38
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:28,024
Never mind.

39
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:29,806
Catch the turn there and pass it.

40
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:35,571
Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again.

41
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:39,977
Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands behind him.

42
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:42,901
And what big generous hands they are, to be sure.

43
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:45,184
These are your iron fists, hey?

44
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:46,826
What a hold they have, too.

45
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:51,172
I wonder, Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere, if she is.

46
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:54,156
She swings with an uncommon long cable, though.

47
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:57,360
There, hammer that knot down, and we've done.

48
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:02,807
So, next to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory.

49
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:05,691
I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will you?

50
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:06,612
Thank ye.

51
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:14,742
They laugh at long togs, so, flask, but seems to me a long-tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat.

52
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:19,048
The tails tapering down that way serve to carry off the water, I see.

53
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,070
Same with cocked hats.

54
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:24,735
The cocks form gable-end eave troughs, flask.

55
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,938
No more monkey jackets and tarpaulins for me.

56
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,322
I must mount a swallow-tail and drive down a beaver, so.

57
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:31,724
Halloa!

58
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:32,625
Hoo!

59
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,010
There goes my tarpaulin overboard.

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,681
Lord, lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly.

61
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:43,358
This is a nasty night, lad.
