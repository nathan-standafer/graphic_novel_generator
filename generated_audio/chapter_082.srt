00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:08,326
Chapter 82 - The Honor and Glory of Wailing. There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method.

2
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:15,660
The more I dive into this matter of wailing, and push my researches up to the very spring head of it so much,

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,166
the more am I impressed with its great honorableness and antiquity.

4
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:35,775
And especially when I find so many great demigods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.

5
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:46,859
The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman, and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.

6
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:55,418
Those were the nightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the distressed and not to fill men's lamp-feeders.

7
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:58,762
Everyone knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda.

8
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:04,289
How the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the seacoast.

9
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:14,683
And as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid.

10
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:21,912
It was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooners of the present day.

11
00:01:21,892 --> 00:01:44,380
Inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart, and let no man doubt this archite story, for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.

12
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,127
When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph.

13
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:54,449
What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this.

14
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:58,108
It was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.

15
00:01:58,949 --> 00:02:07,940
Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda, indeed, by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it, is that famous story of St.

16
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,705
George and the dragon, which dragon I maintain to have been a whale.

17
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:18,393
For in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other.

18
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:26,543
Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea, saith Ezekiel, hereby plainly meaning a whale.

19
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:29,788
In truth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself.

20
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,756
Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St.

21
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:41,026
George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep.

22
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:45,393
Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St.

23
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:49,399
George, a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale.

24
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,205
Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us.

25
00:02:53,489 --> 00:03:09,642
For though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffon-like shape, and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance of those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists,

26
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,585
and considering that as in Perseus's case, St.

27
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:18,432
George's whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach, and considering that the animal ridden by St.

28
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:29,284
George might have been only a large seal or seahorse, bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientist drafts of the scene.

29
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:38,835
In fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that fish, flesh, and foul idol of the Philistines.

30
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:49,190
Dagon by name, who being planted before the Ark of Israel, his horse's head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of him remained.

31
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:56,908
Thus then, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England,

32
00:03:56,888 --> 00:04:02,355
and by good rights we harpooners of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St.

33
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:02,836
George.

34
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:11,548
And therefore, let not the knights of that honorable company, none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron.

35
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:19,559
Let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain, since even in our woolen frocks and tarred trousers we are much better entitled to St.

36
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,782
George's decoration than they.

37
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:42,336
Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remain dubious, for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique Crockett and Kit Carson, that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale, still, whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted.

38
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:48,232
It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside.

39
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:52,779
Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman.

40
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,786
At any rate, the whale caught him, if he did not the whale.

41
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:59,751
I claim him for one of our clan.

42
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:10,732
But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale, and vice versa.

43
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:12,735
Certainly, they are very similar.

44
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:16,623
If I claim the demigod then, why not the prophet?

45
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:23,275
Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole role of our order.

46
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:32,353
Our Grandmaster is still to be named, for like royal kings of old times, we find the headwaters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves.

47
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,508
That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shastra, which gives us the dread Vishnu,

48
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:53,734
One of the three persons in the Godhead of the Hindus gives us this divine Vishnu himself for our Lord, Vishnu, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has forever set apart and sanctified the whale.

49
00:05:54,068 --> 00:06:18,237
When Brahma, or the god of gods, saith the shastra, resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnu to preside over the work, but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnu before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects,

50
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:20,699
These Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters.

51
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:27,767
So Vishnu became incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes.

52
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:30,449
Was not this Vishnu a whaleman then?

53
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,913
Even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?

54
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:39,919
Perseus, Saint George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnu, there's a member role for you.

55
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,262
What club but the whalemans can head off like that?
