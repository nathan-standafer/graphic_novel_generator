1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,992
Chapter 99 - The Doubloon.

2
00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:02,434
Chapter 99 - The Doubloon.

3
00:00:02,474 --> 00:00:25,718
Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarterdeck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast, but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration, it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause and turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him.

4
00:00:25,698 --> 00:00:38,758
When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose, and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast.

5
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:50,777
Then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.

6
00:00:50,757 --> 00:01:05,253
But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them.

7
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:20,410
And some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in the Milky Way.

8
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:32,413
Now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills whence, east and west, over golden sands, the headwaters of many Apactolus flows.

9
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:44,136
And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the vertigris of copper spikes, yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Keto glow.

10
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:57,773
Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the live long nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last.

11
00:01:58,294 --> 00:02:09,448
For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end, and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale's talisman.

12
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:16,643
Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it.

13
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:23,657
Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and tropic token pieces.

14
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:44,312
Here, palms, alpacas, and volcanoes, suns, disks, and stars, ecliptics, horns of plenty, and rich banners waving, are in luxury and profusion stamped, so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.

15
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,598
It so chants that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things.

16
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:54,887
On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL AGUADOR COITO.

17
00:02:55,708 --> 00:03:09,051
So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it, and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn.

18
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:28,187
Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes' summits, from one aflame, a tower on another, on the third a crowing cock, while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra.

19
00:03:28,302 --> 00:03:33,097
Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing.

20
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:39,215
There's something ever egotistical in mountaintops and towers and all other grand and lofty things.

21
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:40,038
Look here.

22
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,666
Three peaks as proud as Lucifer.

23
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:52,885
The firm tower, that is Ahab, the volcano, that is Ahab, the courageous, the undaunted and victorious fowl, that too is Ahab.

24
00:03:53,686 --> 00:04:03,836
All are Ahab, and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician's glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self.

25
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,641
Great pains, small gains for those who ask the world to solve them.

26
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:11,083
It cannot solve itself.

27
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:14,147
Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face.

28
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:15,169
But see!

29
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,034
Ay, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox.

30
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:23,280
And but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Ares.

31
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,964
From storm to storm, so be it then.

32
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:31,111
Born in throes, t'is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs.

33
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:32,273
So be it then.

34
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,916
Here's stout stuff for woe to work on.

35
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:36,919
So be it then.

36
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:46,684
No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil's claws must have left their moldings there since yesterday," murmured Starbutt to himself, leaning against the bulwarks.

37
00:04:47,526 --> 00:04:50,313
The old man seems to read Belshazzar's awful writing.

38
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,900
I have never marked the coin inspectingly.

39
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,844
He goes below, let me read.

40
00:04:55,466 --> 00:05:02,040
A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks that almost seem the Trinity in some faint earthly symbol.

41
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:12,222
So in this veil of death, God girds us round, and over all our gloom, the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope.

42
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:16,312
If we bend down our eyes, the dark veil shows her moldy soil.

43
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:21,421
But if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance halfway, to cheer.

44
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:31,577
Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture, and if, at midnight, we would feign snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain.

45
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:36,145
This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me.

46
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:39,009
I will quit it, lest truth shake me falsely.

47
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:43,136
There now's the old mogul, Soliloquois, stubbed by the try-works.

48
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:52,131
He's been twigging it, and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long.

49
00:05:52,111 --> 00:06:00,038
And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlayer's Hook, I'd not look at it very long ere spending it.

50
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:00,958
Humpf!

51
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:05,042
In my poor insignificant opinion I regard this as queer.

52
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:21,696
I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings, your doubloons of Old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chile, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Papayan, with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles and joes and half-joes and quarter-joes.

53
00:06:21,676 --> 00:06:25,926
What then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing wonderful?

54
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:28,713
By Golconda, let me read it once.

55
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:29,735
Halloa!

56
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:31,780
Here's signs and wonders truly.

57
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:39,398
That now is what old Bowditch in his epitome calls the Zodiac, and what my almanac below calls Ditto.

58
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:49,390
I'll get the almanac, and as I have heard devils can be raised with dables arithmetic, I'll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with a Massachusetts calendar.

59
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,972
Here's the book.

60
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:51,613
Let's see now.

61
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:55,618
Signs and wonders, and the sun, he's always among them.

62
00:06:56,078 --> 00:06:59,542
Hem, hem, hem, here they are, here they go, all alive.

63
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:02,886
Aries, or the ram, Taurus, or the bull and Jemimi.

64
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:05,550
Here's Gemini himself, or the twins.

65
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,473
Well, the sun, he wheels among them.

66
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:14,083
I hear on the coin he's just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting rooms all in a ring.

67
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:15,926
Book, you lie there.

68
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:19,051
The fact is you books must know your places.

69
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:23,979
You'll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts.

70
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:31,913
That's my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar and Bowditch's navigator and Dabble's arithmetic go.

71
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:33,316
Signs and wonders, eh?

72
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:37,664
Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs and significant in wonders.

73
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,367
There's a clue somewhere.

74
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:40,049
Wait a bit.

75
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:40,590
Hissed.

76
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,011
Hark.

77
00:07:41,532 --> 00:07:42,914
By Jove, I have it.

78
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:44,277
Look you, Tabloon.

79
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:47,704
Your Zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter.

80
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:50,369
And now I'll read it off, straight out of the book.

81
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,112
Come, Almanac.

82
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:54,637
To begin, there's Ares, or the ram.

83
00:07:55,238 --> 00:07:58,323
Lecherous dog, he begets us, then Taurus, or the bull.

84
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:01,990
He bumps us the first thing, then Gemini, or the twins.

85
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:06,178
That is, virtue and vice, we try to reach virtue when low.

86
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:14,573
Comes Cancer the crab and drags us back, and here, going from virtue, Leo, a roaring lion, lies in the path.

87
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:20,629
He gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw, we escape and hail Virgo the Virgin.

88
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:24,579
That's our first love, we marry and think to be happy for aye.

89
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:32,899
When pop comes Libra, or the scales, happiness weighed and found wanting, and while we are very sad about that, Lord,

90
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:49,217
How we suddenly jump as Scorpio, or the scorpion, Stings us in the rear, we are curing the wound, When weighing come the arrows all round, Sagittarius, or the archer, is amusing himself, As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside,

91
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:52,163
Here's the battering ram, Capricornus, or the goat.

92
00:08:52,604 --> 00:09:04,489
Full tilt he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed, when Aquarius, or the water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us, and to wind up with Pisces or the fishes we sleep.

93
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:12,416
There's a sermon now, writ in high heaven, And the sun goes through it every year, And yet comes out of it all alive and hearty.

94
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:20,031
Jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trouble, And so allow here does jolly stub.

95
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,922
Oh, jolly's the word for aye.

96
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:25,266
Adieu, doubloon, but stop, here comes little king.

97
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,871
Post, dodge round the tri-works now, and let's hear what he'll have to say.

98
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:33,215
There, he's before it, he'll out with something presently.

99
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:35,197
So, so, he's beginning.

100
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:45,529
I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him.

101
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:47,975
So, what's all this staring been about?

102
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:55,010
It is worth $16, that's true, and at 2 cents the cigar, that's 960 cigars.

103
00:09:55,932 --> 00:10:04,632
I won't smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here's 960 of them, so here goes Flask Aloft to spy him out.

104
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,996
Shall I call that wise or foolish?

105
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,641
Now, if it be really wise, it has a foolish look to it.

106
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:15,468
Yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wise-ish look to it.

107
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,937
But, avast, here comes our old manksman, the old hearse-driver.

108
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:21,818
He must have been.

109
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:24,021
That is, before he took to the sea.

110
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:29,269
He luffs up before the doubloon, halloa, and goes round on the other side of the mast.

111
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,135
Why, there's a horseshoe nailed on that side, and now he's back again.

112
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:34,737
What does that mean?

113
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,903
Hark, he's muttering, voice like an old worn-out coffee mill.

114
00:10:38,923 --> 00:10:40,264
Prick ears and listen.

115
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:46,793
If the white whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day when the sun stands in some one of these signs.

116
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:49,597
I've studied signs and know their marks.

117
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:53,502
They were taught me two score years ago by the old witch in Copenhagen.

118
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:56,366
Now, in what sign will the sun then be?

119
00:10:56,386 --> 00:11:00,071
The horseshoe sign, for there it is right opposite the gold.

120
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:02,614
And what's the horseshoe sign?

121
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:06,659
The lion is the horseshoe sign, the roaring and devouring lion.

122
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,163
Ship, old ship, my old head shakes to think of thee.

123
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:13,968
There's another rendering now, but still one text.

124
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,192
All sorts of men in one kind of world, you see.

125
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:24,501
Dodge again, here comes Queequeg, all tattooing, looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself.

126
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:25,955
What says the cannibal?

127
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:29,523
As I live he's comparing notes, looking at his thigh bone.

128
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:37,943
Thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I suppose, as the old women talk surgeon's astronomy in the back country.

129
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:42,574
And by Jove, he's found something there in the vicinity of his thigh.

130
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:45,358
I guess it's Sagittarius, or the Archer.

131
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,283
No, he don't know what to make of the doubloon.

132
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:51,408
He takes it for an old button off some king's trousers.

133
00:11:52,109 --> 00:12:00,863
But, aside again, here comes that ghost devil, Fidala, tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual.

134
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:03,527
What does he say, with that look of his?

135
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:07,353
Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself.

136
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:10,738
There is a sun on the coin fire, worshipper, depend upon it.

137
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,491
Oh, more and more.

138
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:13,913
This way comes Pip.

139
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:14,794
Poor boy.

140
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:18,518
Would he had died, or I. He's half horrible to me.

141
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:22,402
He too has been watching all of these interpreters, myself included.

142
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,586
And look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot face.

143
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,748
Stand away again and hear him.

144
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:29,349
Hark!

145
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,275
I look, you look, he looks, we look, ye look, ye look, they look.

146
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:40,003
Upon my soul he's been studying Murray's grammar, improving his mind, poor fellow.

147
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:41,806
But what's that he says now?

148
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:42,527
Hissed.

149
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:46,613
I look, you look, he look, he look, ye look, ye look, ye look.

150
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:48,637
Why, he's getting it by heart.

151
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:49,258
Hissed.

152
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:49,979
Again.

153
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:58,613
I look, you look, he look, he look, ye look, ye look, ye look, ye look, ye look, ye look, they look.

154
00:12:58,745 --> 00:12:59,647
Well, that's funny.

155
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:09,366
And I, you, and he, and we, ye, and they, are all bats, and I'm a crow, especially when I stand atop of this pine tree here.

156
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:10,388
Caw!

157
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:10,969
Caw!

158
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,410
Caw!

159
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:11,911
Caw!

160
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:12,372
Caw!

161
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:13,294
Caw!

162
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:14,343
Ain't I a crow?

163
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:16,267
And where's the scarecrow?

164
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:23,784
There he stands, two bones stuck into a pair of old trousers and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket.

165
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:25,548
Wonder if he means me.

166
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,052
Complimentary.

167
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,415
Poor lad.

168
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:30,760
I could go hang myself.

169
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,703
Anyway, for the present, I'll quit Pip's vicinity.

170
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:38,928
I can stand the rest, for they have plain wits, but he's too crazy witty for my sanity.

171
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:41,891
So, so, I leave him muttering.

172
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:47,256
Here's the ship's navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire to unscrew it.

173
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:51,020
But, unscrew your navel, and what's the consequence?

174
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:59,768
Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly too, for when aught's nailed to the mast it's a sign that things grow desperate.

175
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:03,602
Ha, ha, old Ahab, the white whale, he'll nail you.

176
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,684
This is a pine tree.

177
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:14,115
My father, in old Tolland County, cut down a pine tree once and found a silver ring grown over in it, some old darkie's wedding ring.

178
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:15,376
How did it get there?

179
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:24,928
And so they'll say in the resurrection when they come to fish up this old mast and find a doubloon lodged in it with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark.

180
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:29,565
Oh, the gold, the precious, precious gold, the green miseral hoard ye soon.

181
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:33,901
Hish, hish, hish, God goes among the world's blackberrying.

182
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:35,668
Cook, ho, cook, and cook us.

183
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:39,964
Jenny, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny, and get your ho-cake done.
